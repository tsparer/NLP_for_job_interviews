It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table.\",\n",

I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked.\",\n",

It is a mature language and it has been open sourced for a while now thus allowing a nice large community to be formed and the software they build to be compatible with Java. This would provide us the ability to be flexible with our software choices if need be in the future. With regards to the front-end we can use the tried and tested such HTML, CSS, Javascript and their related frameworks.

       "  \"In terms of complexity, I would have to say the Reimbursement Site I've recently completed as a training project. It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table.\",\n",
       "  \"As I've said, my most recent project was the reimbursement site. I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked.\",\n",

It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table.\",\n",

I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked.\",\n",

After spending a couple of years there, I did leave the company because there were no growth opportunities at the time. I ended up getting a teaching position in China and uprooted myself for a year of teaching and travel throughout Asia. When I came back, I jumped right into the tech start up scene again with a position at Belly Card where I was a part of the 7-11 team.

Following that I was at another start up in the commercial cleaning industry as an Account Manager as well as Operations Manager.

       " 1: \" In terms of complexity, I would have to say the Reimbursement Site I've recently completed as a training project. It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table. As I've said, my most recent project was the reimbursement site. I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked. I've learned about how to use servlets and AJAX calls to get databases and websites working together, and how to connect to databases from Java. I've also learned that JavaScript can be too lenient for the programmer's own good.  I like that python is relatively simple, but also highly versatile. I also like the dictionary collection type, as i find that the key-value pairings make organizing and retrieving data much simpler (I've got to explore this advantage in detail in an Information Retrieval course I took in Spring). Mostly I'm just happy to have an opportunity to learn more about software development and gain more experience that will help me in the industry. I admit that I am unfamiliar with .Net programs, which I've seen come up on a few job postings, so I feel that it's something I could use. I also would like to learn more about Angular, which I've only touched upon. I feel that it helps when I have some sort of deadline to meet. Say I have a project that requires me to use knowledge I don't have, so I'll try to find examples of that knowledge in action, in pieces if I must, and work from that to get my program working.

SQL and git are the things I would probably most like to learn but any chance to deepen my knowledge is something I will be excited for.

       " 8: \" The biggest project that I have worked on would be a collaborative effort that revolved around making a software to provide video rentals A recent project that I worked on from A to Z would be a chat client that was done in Node.js. On the project we were asked to set up different objects for both those chatting and the rooms that they would be entering\\n\\nFrom the beginning, you were only primarily concerned with the people in the chat, them being unique to an array of different javascript users and being contained in their own chat room. Once the functionality was figured out there via different mocha tests, an HTML page was set up to keep track of user logs and to keep it contained within the individual chats. For added fun, we added a feature that would send our location, in much the same way that a real client keeps track of your location The best part of the process was that it was centered around the front end of a Node.js project. Most of the new skills I learned were centered around that framework, with a bit of exposure to jQuery and how to use the fields on the page to extract data to different objects.\\n\\nIn a lot of ways, Javascript and the accompanying technologies are very open-ended to use, but it all seems very portable to since it can function for both personal and enterprise projects  The most ideal thing that I look for with a new opportunity is having the right people in place to help foster my growth as a programmer and more importantly as a problem solver. Too often we get caught up in the great things happening today in technology that we forget that there are small steps to get there that require both discipline and a good frame of mind. So I'd love to just jump in to maintaining projects and learning the right practices from people already there New languages that I would love to learn would be more .NET simply because of the wide number of enterprise places using it, and python since a lot of the math centered functions there would help supplement the mathematics I learned in college\\n\\nAs for tech, Electron, React, and Spring Boot are some of the more bustling things that I would love to take a look at for personal projects At times it is important to take a step back and learn the beginning things from time to time. If you can learn the beginnings of a language or if you can see small demonstrations in action, usually more often than not, the rest comes just as easy, if not faster and you gain additional enjoyment having something concrete to play with With something such as AWS or Maven, the right tool for the job comes down to how you feel you want your data presented. Is it something that can be done in an SQL solution, is the data more dynamic and requiring noSQL solutions such as mongoDB, along with a variety of other data solutions that AWS may include\\n\\nAs for building stuff with maven, those usually come with the basic requirements of a java project. Additional type checking, build tests, simplified database connection and interaction, automation with functions, etc. No Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-montano-4b21b9a3/ Thank you\",\n",

I believe I can answer this questions of yours based on the projects that I've worked on. To talk about the most complex project, I should tell you about the one that I worked on when I started off my graduate studies. I developed an algorithm to find the shortest path between any 2 stations in New York subway. I had to gather all the maps pertaining to the subway system. And I found out all the junction points where we can make transfers to different lines. I had to make sure that I didn't miss even a single junction point, as that would lead to miscalculations. I applied Dijkstra's algorithm for that project. And I developed the project using Java. But, I tried out other languages to improve my knowledge. Sure.  I like the versatility of the language. One can literally do wonders with Python. It covers various domains that I can work on. And there are so many libraries that make my work easier. I've always searched for new things to learn and challenges to face. The projects that I work on are chosen keeping that in mind. That being said, I'm looking for new opportunities to showcase my skills, solve complex problems and grow along with the organization. There are 2 things that I'd like to try my hands on. One being the different frameworks of Javascript, as there's a plethora out there. And the other being mobile app development: iOS and Android. I've chosen this field as my career because I find it interesting and challenging. I know for a fact that I have to dedicate my life to it if I have to be successful. That being said, I believe one shouldn't search for time or motivation to acquire new knowledge, as it is implicit that one should focus on this at all times. To be frank, I've used Azure more than AWS. However, picking the right tools depends only on 2 factors, according to me. They are: 1.The problem we are dealing with, and, 2. Customer preference I hold an employment authorization and I'm authorized to work for any employer in the US without any restriction. But probably in a few years of time, I'd need sponsorship.

       " 18: ' I have worked in a software development company for a year where I had to design software for online banking. Most of my clients were well renounced banks in Nepal. I had to retrieve datas from UI such as android apps with the use of JSON. And manipulate those data into the banks system. So the most resent project I had to work for was another banking system which uses a kind of online payment method which is similar to what PayPal does. Had to incorporate that into online transaction through the bank itself. Retrieving information on the account used to make the purchase and handling data security was something I was in charge of. I learned how to make the system more secured and to decrease the runtime of the program itself so that the process was smooth and had a good flow. I learnt more about restful server while working on this project. I also learnt about the flow towards the backend of the system. I found that the entire task should not fall back on the UI side but also the backend of the system to make the software you have designed more stable and secure.  I like that the code is not as complex to use and in a Linux system it does wonders. I’m all about using c programming on a Linux system but python helped me cut down so much of the coding process because of its features. I’m all about team work and communication when I’m working on a project. I feel like it’s one of the main aspect to help build a company. I also look forward towards proper planning and management while working on a project. In addition to that as technology keeps on updating itself so I feel like it’s important for a company to crate a good learning environment as well. These days I have been wanting to work more on .net. I have heard so much about it and would love to see how it would work with the ideas I have I understand it’s time consuming which is why I tend to do those things on my off time and not on the company’s time. I in person love research work and accruing new knowledge in my free time. It’s kind of an early hobby I acquired as a child. It’s my hobby to look into things and find something interesting to read. I guess my motivation is my willingness to learn more. For me I have mostly worked on Maven then on cloud. I feel like picking out the right tool for the job would depend on what type of features the client want and analyzing what would go well with what the client wants.

In terms of complexity, I would rate it a 6/10 (10 being extremely complex and 1 being trivial). The project previously stated was the most recent project I have worked on, and it was an application aimed at competitive users of the popular online card game Hearthstone. I worked with a group of 5 peers. First, I made the project specifications and design. Then, I broke my team up into smaller groups to focus on front and back end. I ended up joining the back end team. I was responsible for setting up certain tables for our database to hold both user and deck information. I then wrote the code for the API that interacted with our server in order to process commands on the user side. I forgot to mention the testing aspect of the process, in which I wrote code in order to test as many lines of written code as possible. I had to learn Javascript (enough to get the application done) to make this application possible. Another aspect I learned about making software is the planning that needs to be done beforehand, such as specification and design documents.

       " 25: \" The biggest project software project I've worked on is a game project currently under development by myself and 3 other associates. I am one of 2 primary programmers on the job, the other programmer being in charge of determining what we need, and myself primarily filling in those needs. The last project I was present for from beginning to end is a front-end design for a UX course. I, along with 2 others, were responsible from coming up with an application idea and implementing the agile process to get a prototype finished and polished. Being more hands-on that conceptual myself, I took responsibility for translating our needs into designs, and our designs into a program. The software accommodates enough cases that, should it be turned into a fully function application, there is minimal work needed to address an overall diverse user base. I learned a lot about prototyping software, and how it differs from other types of design software, as well as typical programming languages or IDEs. Beyond learning the ways in which a design should be both indicative of a purpose and functional to meet that end, I also learned a lot about working on a team where there are multiple types of tasks that need to be divided up. Prior experiences with teams were moreso about 4 people solving the same task together, as opposed to multiple people solving individual tasks to bring one larger project to life.  The chance to learn and grow around people who actually want me to learn and grow. I always strive for new experiences to come with knowledge and ideas that I can take away with me afterwards. While grinding away at a task just to get it done is entirely functional, I think that as an individual, I can both gain more and, subsequently, contribute more if I have room to improve and am encouraged to do so. I want to learn more about data transfer -- the way in which data moves from software to software, hardware to hardware, machine to person, and vice versa. Data itself is an abstract and system-agnostic thing, so the act of moving it between different mediums has always fascinated me, and I think a world where we welcome a more fluid transfer of data is a world that will learn and evolve a lot faster, and be more well-informed along the way. In terms of languages behind this, I suppose this primarily encompasses network-related frameworks. Well, as I mentioned in an earlier response, I try to make every experience into a learning experience. Surely there are times where the necessary thing is to just do a task the way it's always been done, but when it comes to problem solving, which is what programming is at its core, there's always room for something novel. I don't agree that learning needs to be time consuming, at least in a way that detracts from the primary tasks at hand. It's all about how you approach work itself, and that goes beyond programming. There's always room for something new, working and learning do not need to be exclusive. I have no prior experience with stacks, but given my current knowledge and skills, I'd likely go for MEAN. No. Yes. https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-cho-67299112a/ thanks.\",\n",

The same can be done with a messy complex logic or with an efficient rule based engine we deployed.

The live EMS/Scada data was fed into the application and the application would reflect it in terms of MW consumed by the consumer. The appliation had a feature to forecast their energy needs based on previous consumption and predict live data. A key feature of the appliaction was messaging. We used ActiveMQ built on JMS and Topics for a publisher subscriber model and Queues for a point to point model. I worked on the ActiveMQ from scratch The company though huge and serves over to 400,000 consumers for their electricity needs. The IT team was relatively small and we had to bridge the gap of Business Analysts, we the team(6 people with 3 developers) would directly interract with the production managers gaining valuable business skills.

Before we began the actual process of coding, we pre-wrote all of the required tests for every function. During delvelopment, we frequently checked in with the customer (the professor) to make sure things were progressing as desired. Command pattern, the idea of pre-writing tests before coding begins and it was my first time going through the whole process of agile development.  C++ and C#. I like both with a preference towards C#. I like to think that C# feels like Java with the power of C++ behind it. Feels smooth, clean and fast. Additionally, C# can be used in a lot of places Java or C++ might not be able to be used, like webpages. I'd rather like to be in a position where I can have some sort of positive effect on people through the software I help develop. I'd like to learn more about AI and just programming in general. It's an ever changing field and that what I like about it, you can't stop learning. Usually I learn new things as they come up. I like to think that Google has been my best teacher. There's always a better solution, so I search it out and learn as much as I can along the way. This allows me to connect ideas together in new ways and apply them. To be honest, I'm not familiar with those tools. However that doesn't mean I cannot learn. If I were to be thrown into a situation where I'd have to use them, I'd ask. I'd ask the people who know better than me. I can't know everything, and neither can anyone else, but by asking I can at least learn from them to make better decisions in the future.

Earlier this year I developed a predictor for March Madness. It's a statistical analysis project written in Python. I first decided which data I would use and some ideologies that I wanted the model to keep true to. I then wrote the data collector and then the first version of the model itself. The predictor failed to meet expectations for the most recent tournament based on historical results. I realized some of the data I'm using includes tournament results and biases the model towards teams that did well in the tournament. Work on the predictor is ongoing with hopes to improve results for the next tournament. This project was my first foray into statistical analysis, so I learned about some of the Python libraries used in that.  I like that it's easy to jump into. You can start a project very easily, while still having access to many powerful libraries. I also enjoy the style of writing in Python.

Currently, we're working on project to migrate customers from our existing legacy into the Hybris platform.

I followed up with business analyst to confirm names, and add the newer fields not previously on the request. Gotten approval, compiled changes in test environment, and ran both Unit and regression tests. Upon completion, moved changes to preprod environment for business analyst for final review.

I had to use Hadoop, AI techniques like SVM, Particle Swarm Optimization(Genetic algorithm), Fuzzy C-Means, core Java, NLP techniques to clean and prepare(tokenize) newspaper articles from multiple languages and to convert them to English. \\n\\nIn short, the task was to collect newspaper articles from 3 languages, convert them to English and create a mini search engine which will find the documents and then redirect to its origin language. Since there were many articles, I had to use Hadoop. The most recent project that I handled all by myself was an Android app. One day I had an idea - how about we create a summary of a journey from point A to point B without the user doing anything else. So I started from scratch, got used to the Android environment and made a lot of mistakes. Since I was the only person handling it, many bugs were found in the first version which took about 2 months(as I was completing my Masters along with the project). The biggest hurdle was to create a video illusion using programming given that I have all co-ordinates of that vehicle/person from point A to point B and I didn\\' I am completing the last answer here. \"find anything online.

Coming to this question - My main aim of Masters and to come to US was to get accustomed to AI/Machine Learning. SO in the past 2 years I took 8 out of 10 courses in ML/AI. It was challenging in the beginning but I got the hold of it by the end as new frameworks seem to pop out everyday and its not worth it to learn each one. However, I achieved what I wanted - to understand under the hood workings of AI and its use in real life applications  Because its compact and its usually the language of AI frameworks, however there are Java frameworks too I am a recent graduate, but I want to learn as much as possible and take on responsibility along with a little guidance from the experienced coders.

At Vital Proteins I began my career as the Customer Advocacy Manager, where I implemented new procedures and built out the entire team. From there, I moved into a sales manager role overseeing all beauty accounts. While all roles had their differences, customer success is always at the forefont. at a high level yes   yes While at Vital Proteins we used sales force CRM software to gather metrics, customer analytics, etc to get a greater idea of our consumer and the best methods of interaction. However, we inevitable phased out the software and developed a customized portal. Leading with education and a positive approach is my management philosophy. Knowing the 'why', and creating a route from that starting point has been a great lesson. With customer support teams, there can be times when the energy may become dull due to the nature of the department- complaints, concerns, etc. Taking time to see the positives, and recognizing teammates does a lot to boost morale. While managing the customer advocacy team at Vital, it was high stress as the company was scaling so fast. End of day check-ins worked well to hear everyone's grievances, and start the next day on positive footing. A milestone would be gaining placement in large national retailers like Anthropologie and Nordstrom. Leading a team that helped put a tasting menu presentation together took a great deal of planning in terms of logistics and education. By delegating tasks and trusting my teams ability we were able to be successful. Organization is key! Calendars and spreadsheets are essential to not only keep track, but schedule follow-ups.

       " 119: \" Ok! My entire career has been in customer service, in one way or another. I spent about 6 years working in Hospitality with a majority of that time spent with Marriott. I grew a very solid foundation of customer service skills working for this company and have continued to utilize that training throughout my career. After working in the hospitality industry, I completely pivoted to a tech startup where I was an Account Consultant, helping service customers and their web based businesses. After spending a couple of years there, I did leave the company because there were no growth opportunities at the time. I ended up getting a teaching position in China and uprooted myself for a year of teaching and travel throughout Asia. When I came back, I jumped right into the tech start up scene again with a position at Belly Card where I was a part of the 7-11 team. I had my hand in a lot of different projects and support aspects there before I was laid off. Following that I was at another start up in the commercial cleaning industry as an Account Manager as well as Operations Manager. And now to my current role at Snapsheet where I have been for almost 2 years. I'm currently a Customer Success Manager for our Inbound call team, as well as manage 4 of our other managers. No. I do not have direct experience with marketing technology. No I started my career in the Hotel industry. When I moved into tech it was with SingleHop, which sells servers. At Belly Card we sold a tech platform for digital loyalty. At OfficeLuv we had a tech solution for office supply replenishment and cleaning services. At SnapSheet we have a tech platform to expedite the claims process for auto accidents.  The ease of being able to house all of a clients information in one spot, including email communications, appointment dates, and services they are subscribed to. It's a great one-stop-shop for their data. I am very proud of the team I'm currently coaching. It's a team of 15 individuals who service our incoming call volume to the company. It can be a high stress position due to the volume of calls we service, and not knowing the nature of what that inbound call is going to entail. I had the opportunity of launching our very first inbound team last summer, and am incredibly proud to be able to look back and see where we are today because going in we didn't know what to expect. It took a lot of trial and error to understand how we needed to service our customers, how many agents we needed staffed, and what specific phone Q's we needed to add. Those that helped in it's launch knew going in that it was going to be kind of crazy, but we knew that together we'd get through it. And we did. Today we have built out better processes surrounding what our Inbound team looks like and the service that we give to our customers. We have the highest QA scores amongst the rest of the organization, and that is something that I take great pride in. That I am able to give them the support that they need to be successful, and that I can coach to our quality standards. I liken customer retention to employee retention. Even your top performers need to have the same touch points as your low performers, because once you get comfortable and think they're solid with where there at, that's when the problems start. It's important to make sure that metrics are in place for each account, growth milestones, and to have proper communication cadence in place to stay ahead of the ball. I think it's important for a customer to feel like you are their go-to person, and that they can trust you. At the end of the day, we are all humans, and making that human connection with a client is going to do wonders for the overall health of the account. The most important thing is having tools in place to be able to do my job well. One of the most challenging things that I currently go through is not having those tools, and trying to make the best out of what I do. For example, there are a lot of inconsistencies with data which makes it difficult for us to be able to forecast accurately for business needs. Oftentimes when going through employee reviews, the tools we have to support their performance is lacking. Additionally, clear growth and variety in work is very important to me.

All of my experiences have lended themselves to a robust understanding of what creates a client for life.  the endless possibilities.  With integrations and an inward flow of data, Salesforce can be used to monitor the health of a given client or segment at any given time.  The user friendliness of the reports and dashboards give internal users great insight to where the clientbase stands at any given moment i currently lead 2 cross-functional teams (5 client success managers, and 5 Field Service reps) that have worked together to hit our retention and sales metrics.  I'm proud of the fact that we've built this from the ground up.  This Client Success function didn't exist prior to my arrival and retention was low.  We've been able to come in and turn around the customer sentiment, keep people on the platform, and we grew the existing client base by over 10% last year. In order to retain clients, it's important to make sure that they are using and getting value out of the system.  I look at things like how many people are using the product at a given client, who sees the data, how often, how many different departments are seeing value - how deep are our roots.  It's important to track how they are using the system, are they using it at a very basic level, do they have all the bells and whistles, are they using the system in the way it was designed, are they engaging in feedback loops to constantly improve the product.  I also like to take into consideration things like contract growth, NPS, and satisfaction scores as well as client side parameters like POC turnover, executive turnover, and overall company health.  When any of these things change, there is a playbook for what happens to make sure that everything gets back in balance. I'm looking for a great, stable company that client-centric and understands that Customer Success isn't just a role, but a company mindset.

I started out as a sales associate, then was promoted to the position of floor supervisor. In 2000 I took a position with Wireless retail as an implementation manager, and in that role I worked with employees in five state region teaching best customer service practices and working to staff out locations with the best candidates available. In 2010 I embarked on a career path in higher education as an admissions advisor, the role of admissions advisor requires one to have excellent customer service and relationship building skills while being able to gain an understanding of client needs and being able to articulate a path to help them reach career and life goals. I followed that path to Career Education Corporation, and then on the Adler University where I has able to add to my skill set and learn how to best meet customer need. The career experience in addition to my educational background in business management have allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the customer success field, while learning how to be effective in leadership and helping to train and inspire others to work as a team to reach organizational goals. Yes  I like that Salesforce is a custom designed CRM that is implemented with the specific needs of the organization that is using it. Salesforce is easily navigable and helps to manage a large data base of leads. The last team I lead was with Career Education Corporation where I functioned as a department lead, my specific team consisted of eight advisors and I was tasked with developing best practices that lead to the better handling of leads, timely follow up, and superior customer service. We were able to routinely hit our monthly enrollment targets and stand out among other teams that we were compared to. I am most proud of the camaraderie that we developed as a team, and the way we were able to utilize the talents of each team member to meet our goals. My approach to managing customer health is the building of relationships with the customers we interact with, many times the area of opportunity that is missed is building the necessary rapport with the client base. It is imperative that the customer can feel that the person(s) that they are interacting with has a genuine care for them and the service that they are being provided. Metrics are key, measuring factors like customers contacted in a work day, timely follow up, and product knowledge all lead to good customer health. Ultimately thins factors can be positively effected by leaders paying attention to detail, and taking time to cultivate and develop their team.

In 2017, my team finished first amongst the 13 VPs in the Specialized Industry division, and we were #8 overall in the entire company out of about a dozen of teams. My approach is monitoring key metrics such as overall product usage, depth of usage, breadth of usage, account growth, customer account lifespan, renewals achieved, upsell numbers, survey results/ customer feedback, customer's executives' relationship with my company, and customer support performance. These KPIs and metrics help determine the direction of everything from customer support to sales, product development, and overall company direction; they provide insight and influence all aspects of a business.

       " 195: ' I enjoy helping others achieve a desired goal. I am very extroverted so I get a thrill speaking with others. I accomplish easier tasks as soon as possible, so I can focus on higher priority or larger projects more in depth. I also use my organization skills to prioritize. Yes I personally improved customer retention rates through constant communication with clients, offering discounts (with approval) or more focus if the client seemed to be unhappy. Through communication is also a key to success (monthly or weekly meetings with the client).  Budgeting, or the reliability of the software (example: how does the software work with scalability of users). Or does the software fully suit the customers needs. I have over three years of experience. In person at a company conference, at vendor booths, through training clients, or a weekly demos to either find new clients or introduce my current clients to more parts of the software. Yes, no more than 20%  I am currently employed so I need 2 weeks notice. Yes. With 2 weeks notice to my current employer Yes Yes Yes, I have to pull it up. One second please.

Additionally, I enjoy cultivating relationships with my clients. I lean heavily on to-do lists broken down by client and prioritized. Then, I block time on my calendar each day to work on these projects amongst the other meetings that are going on. Yes By having a healthy paranoia with each account. If you assume each client is completely satisfied, you open the door to unpleasant surprises. Instead my teams have always managed our accounts trying to uncover anything that might be upsetting the client.  When I worked at HighGround, I was constantly tasked at presenting product demos that were tailored to the specific clients needs. Sometimes this would mean presenting a quick high level overview, and other times diving into the fine details. Above all, it was important to understand the audience and what they were looking to get out of the conversation. I have used GoToMeeting and Join.me Yes  yes yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinsgoldstein/',\n",
       " 197: \" I love working with the clients and solving their problems. The unique problems that they bring to me are like puzzles, and I love to push my mind to greater height and working with clients allows me to do that. Open communication with my bosses, so that they know what I'm working on as well as I'll know that I'm focusing on the most important things. I also utilize my outlook calendar, trello, jira, and other online project management tools to make sure that I'm organized and optimizing my time. Yes I spearheaded this project, we looked at the account analytics and figured out that account who purchased an annual subscription retained at a higher rate, so I reached out to monthly accounts that had a high enough engagement score and attempted to convert them to an annual subscription. I also provide very personal customer service that makes the accounts feel the love!  Customers leave because they don't feel they need the service. I feel like that falls under all of those categories. When it comes down to it, if you haven't built a relationship and onboard/trained the customer well enough to where the software isn't sticky, if they are not getting the results they want, they'll leave. I have presented product demos for Wonderlic's proprietary software, as well as presenting and training people to use our online marketing platform. I have used Google Analytics, Google AdWords, Adobe Creative Cloud, Final Cut Pro, Avid, Wordpress, Netsuite, Olark, JIRA, Trello, WordPress, Google Suite, and Microsoft Office.

       " 198: \" I have been working with Clients be it over the phone and or in person. And I find that for any company to be successful, it depends on how you treat the client with respect, and know how to retain them. I go about my day setting daily goals about what's important 1st, and what needs to be pushed back. But things do change, so I just make sure it's added to calendar to be taken care of right away or towards the end of the day. But I have to thank my project management skills. It's helped me to this very day. Yes By always updating them on new software coming out, and trying to see if we can get discount before it's priced.  Sales Force is the last software I used. I find it to be really user friendly because I can shear my screen with the client, or I just travel to clients location. Yes I am. Will this be base or just salary?  No Yes Yes Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/bamidele-shodiya-82380950/ Thanks very much. Will be looking forward to your response.\",\n",

A lot of corporations are looking for ways to make sure and maintain their value to customers, as well as have there own needs met The secret to time management is making sure to develop a daily and weekly schedule always.  set things on those to-do lists in order of precedence they take within that day/week.  I like to check things off as I go, and having that plan is fundamental to success. No I have not, but I am extremely familiar with some of the concepts, as well as several computer and POS systems, as well as reviewing data/analytics. No I have a scientific/mathematic background from my degree in Biology and Neuroscience.  I have over 10 years in customer service experience face-to-face.  Much of this experience is business oriented, and making sure that these clients are up to date and are put into the right products and services to not only streamline their own businesses, but to increase overall revenue.  In addition to my analytical background, I also have a strong background in innovation and arts.  Creativity is fundamental to finding success in any problem solving situations.  Well I have demonstrated different types of home products from a technological standpoint.

It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table. As I've said, my most recent project was the reimbursement site. I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked. I've learned about how to use servlets and AJAX calls to get databases and websites working together, and how to connect to databases from Java. I've also learned that JavaScript can be too lenient for the programmer's own good.  I like that python is relatively simple, but also highly versatile. I also like the dictionary collection type, as i find that the key-value pairings make organizing and retrieving data much simpler (I've got to explore this advantage in detail in an Information Retrieval course I took in Spring). Mostly I'm just happy to have an opportunity to learn more about software development and gain more experience that will help me in the industry. I admit that I am unfamiliar with .Net programs, which I've seen come up on a few job postings, so I feel that it's something I could use. I also would like to learn more about Angular, which I've only touched upon. I feel that it helps when I have some sort of deadline to meet. Say I have a project that requires me to use knowledge I don't have, so I'll try to find examples of that knowledge in action, in pieces if I must, and work from that to get my program working. I admit to being relatively new to full stack, so Maven, AWS, TomCat and Git are all that I'm really familiar with. No Yes www.linkedin.com/in/martin-melody     https://github.com/mmelody588\"},\n",

On the project we were asked to set up different objects for both those chatting and the rooms that they would be entering\\n\\nFrom the beginning, you were only primarily concerned with the people in the chat, them being unique to an array of different javascript users and being contained in their own chat room. Once the functionality was figured out there via different mocha tests, an HTML page was set up to keep track of user logs and to keep it contained within the individual chats. For added fun, we added a feature that would send our location, in much the same way that a real client keeps track of your location The best part of the process was that it was centered around the front end of a Node.js project. Most of the new skills I learned were centered around that framework, with a bit of exposure to jQuery and how to use the fields on the page to extract data to different objects.\\n\\nIn a lot of ways, Javascript and the accompanying technologies are very open-ended to use, but it all seems very portable to since it can function for both personal and enterprise projects  The most ideal thing that I look for with a new opportunity is having the right people in place to help foster my growth as a programmer and more importantly as a problem solver. Too often we get caught up in the great things happening today in technology that we forget that there are small steps to get there that require both discipline and a good frame of mind. So I'd love to just jump in to maintaining projects and learning the right practices from people already there New languages that I would love to learn would be more .NET simply because of the wide number of enterprise places using it, and python since a lot of the math centered functions there would help supplement the mathematics I learned in college\\n\\nAs for tech, Electron, React, and Spring Boot are some of the more bustling things that I would love to take a look at for personal projects At times it is important to take a step back and learn the beginning things from time to time. If you can learn the beginnings of a language or if you can see small demonstrations in action, usually more often than not, the rest comes just as easy, if not faster and you gain additional enjoyment having something concrete to play with With something such as AWS or Maven, the right tool for the job comes down to how you feel you want your data presented. Is it something that can be done in an SQL solution, is the data more dynamic and requiring noSQL solutions such as mongoDB, along with a variety of other data solutions that AWS may include\\n\\nAs for building stuff with maven, those usually come with the basic requirements of a java project.

I believe I can answer this questions of yours based on the projects that I've worked on. To talk about the most complex project, I should tell you about the one that I worked on when I started off my graduate studies. I developed an algorithm to find the shortest path between any 2 stations in New York subway. I had to gather all the maps pertaining to the subway system. And I found out all the junction points where we can make transfers to different lines. I had to make sure that I didn't miss even a single junction point, as that would lead to miscalculations. I applied Dijkstra's algorithm for that project. And I developed the project using Java. But, I tried out other languages to improve my knowledge. Sure.  I like the versatility of the language. One can literally do wonders with Python. It covers various domains that I can work on. And there are so many libraries that make my work easier. I've always searched for new things to learn and challenges to face. The projects that I work on are chosen keeping that in mind. That being said, I'm looking for new opportunities to showcase my skills, solve complex problems and grow along with the organization. There are 2 things that I'd like to try my hands on. One being the different frameworks of Javascript, as there's a plethora out there. And the other being mobile app development: iOS and Android. I've chosen this field as my career because I find it interesting and challenging. I know for a fact that I have to dedicate my life to it if I have to be successful. That being said, I believe one shouldn't search for time or motivation to acquire new knowledge, as it is implicit that one should focus on this at all times. To be frank, I've used Azure more than AWS. However, picking the right tools depends only on 2 factors, according to me. They are: 1.The problem we are dealing with, and, 2. Customer preference I hold an employment authorization and I'm authorized to work for any employer in the US without any restriction. But probably in a few years of time, I'd need sponsorship.

I had to retrieve datas from UI such as android apps with the use of JSON. And manipulate those data into the banks system. So the most resent project I had to work for was another banking system which uses a kind of online payment method which is similar to what PayPal does. Had to incorporate that into online transaction through the bank itself. Retrieving information on the account used to make the purchase and handling data security was something I was in charge of. I learned how to make the system more secured and to decrease the runtime of the program itself so that the process was smooth and had a good flow. I learnt more about restful server while working on this project. I also learnt about the flow towards the backend of the system. I found that the entire task should not fall back on the UI side but also the backend of the system to make the software you have designed more stable and secure.  I like that the code is not as complex to use and in a Linux system it does wonders. I’m all about using c programming on a Linux system but python helped me cut down so much of the coding process because of its features. I’m all about team work and communication when I’m working on a project. I feel like it’s one of the main aspect to help build a company. I also look forward towards proper planning and management while working on a project. In addition to that as technology keeps on updating itself so I feel like it’s important for a company to crate a good learning environment as well. These days I have been wanting to work more on .net. I have heard so much about it and would love to see how it would work with the ideas I have I understand it’s time consuming which is why I tend to do those things on my off time and not on the company’s time. I in person love research work and accruing new knowledge in my free time. It’s kind of an early hobby I acquired as a child. It’s my hobby to look into things and find something interesting to read. I guess my motivation is my willingness to learn more. For me I have mostly worked on Maven then on cloud. I feel like picking out the right tool for the job would depend on what type of features the client want and analyzing what would go well with what the client wants. Yes I’m on OPT right now with STEM extension for two more years so I have a good three years to work in the United States.

The project previously stated was the most recent project I have worked on, and it was an application aimed at competitive users of the popular online card game Hearthstone. I worked with a group of 5 peers. First, I made the project specifications and design. Then, I broke my team up into smaller groups to focus on front and back end. I ended up joining the back end team. I was responsible for setting up certain tables for our database to hold both user and deck information. I then wrote the code for the API that interacted with our server in order to process commands on the user side. I forgot to mention the testing aspect of the process, in which I wrote code in order to test as many lines of written code as possible. I had to learn Javascript (enough to get the application done) to make this application possible. Another aspect I learned about making software is the planning that needs to be done beforehand, such as specification and design documents. I also learned how to communicate and work with others to meet deadlines.  C; Funny thing is I don't prefer C (I actually kind of dislike it), I just learned it in school enough to complete certain applications.

I, along with 2 others, were responsible from coming up with an application idea and implementing the agile process to get a prototype finished and polished. Being more hands-on that conceptual myself, I took responsibility for translating our needs into designs, and our designs into a program. The software accommodates enough cases that, should it be turned into a fully function application, there is minimal work needed to address an overall diverse user base. I learned a lot about prototyping software, and how it differs from other types of design software, as well as typical programming languages or IDEs. Beyond learning the ways in which a design should be both indicative of a purpose and functional to meet that end, I also learned a lot about working on a team where there are multiple types of tasks that need to be divided up. Prior experiences with teams were moreso about 4 people solving the same task together, as opposed to multiple people solving individual tasks to bring one larger project to life.  The chance to learn and grow around people who actually want me to learn and grow. I always strive for new experiences to come with knowledge and ideas that I can take away with me afterwards. While grinding away at a task just to get it done is entirely functional, I think that as an individual, I can both gain more and, subsequently, contribute more if I have room to improve and am encouraged to do so. I want to learn more about data transfer -- the way in which data moves from software to software, hardware to hardware, machine to person, and vice versa. Data itself is an abstract and system-agnostic thing, so the act of moving it between different mediums has always fascinated me, and I think a world where we welcome a more fluid transfer of data is a world that will learn and evolve a lot faster, and be more well-informed along the way. In terms of languages behind this, I suppose this primarily encompasses network-related frameworks. Well, as I mentioned in an earlier response, I try to make every experience into a learning experience. Surely there are times where the necessary thing is to just do a task the way it's always been done, but when it comes to problem solving, which is what programming is at its core, there's always room for something novel. I don't agree that learning needs to be time consuming, at least in a way that detracts from the primary tasks at hand. It's all about how you approach work itself, and that goes beyond programming. There's always room for something new, working and learning do not need to be exclusive. I have no prior experience with stacks, but given my current knowledge and skills, I'd likely go for MEAN. No. Yes. https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-cho-67299112a/ thanks.\"},\n",

The telecommunication domain application helps business associates to refer how long does the provisioning of a service takes to assist them with actual customer ordering. The challenge was to create a ruling engine based on the different types of requirements and parameters. The same can be done with a messy complex logic or with an efficient rule based engine we deployed. The combination of rules are embedded as database entries and the variations of the rules will be evaluated by querying out and outputing the value, instead of endless conditional expressions. The recent project could be the one when I was with Inference Analytics on Spring 2018, the requirement was to deploy predictive healthcare models on AWS. The predictive model built by machine learning algorithms are converted into python pickle for serialization. The prediction happen when an end user input values and the model spits out the most accurate prediction. A rest web service in python flask is created which accepts the values and outputs the predictions. An appropriate web interface in HTML, CSS, JavaScript , jQuery, AJAX is created where the users can input the values and call for the web service. A restricted user login is provided for the web interface with python flash hashing method.

The live EMS/Scada data was fed into the application and the application would reflect it in terms of MW consumed by the consumer. The appliation had a feature to forecast their energy needs based on previous consumption and predict live data. A key feature of the appliaction was messaging.

I worked on the ActiveMQ from scratch The company though huge and serves over to 400,000 consumers for their electricity needs. The IT team was relatively small and we had to bridge the gap of Business Analysts, we the team(6 people with 3 developers) would directly interract with the production managers gaining valuable business skills. We were involved in deploying the application on the servers too, using load balancers, procuring servers thus bridging the gap of the Operational Team too. It was a very goid learning experience.

Although not actively used, we put a lot of effort into making the interface as usable and friendly as possible. Addionally we used command pattern throughout the project. Again, the above is my best example. We started with requirement elicitation, use cases, class diagram, etc. After that we made a framework for the program's structure with command pattern in mind. Before we began the actual process of coding, we pre-wrote all of the required tests for every function. During delvelopment, we frequently checked in with the customer (the professor) to make sure things were progressing as desired. Command pattern, the idea of pre-writing tests before coding begins and it was my first time going through the whole process of agile development.  C++ and C#.

Earlier this year I developed a predictor for March Madness. It's a statistical analysis project written in Python. I first decided which data I would use and some ideologies that I wanted the model to keep true to. I then wrote the data collector and then the first version of the model itself. The predictor failed to meet expectations for the most recent tournament based on historical results. I realized some of the data I'm using includes tournament results and biases the model towards teams that did well in the tournament. Work on the predictor is ongoing with hopes to improve results for the next tournament.

I had to use Hadoop, AI techniques like SVM, Particle Swarm Optimization(Genetic algorithm), Fuzzy C-Means, core Java, NLP techniques to clean and prepare(tokenize) newspaper articles from multiple languages and to convert them to English. \\n\\nIn short, the task was to collect newspaper articles from 3 languages, convert them to English and create a mini search engine which will find the documents and then redirect to its origin language. Since there were many articles, I had to use Hadoop. The most recent project that I handled all by myself was an Android app. One day I had an idea - how about we create a summary of a journey from point A to point B without the user doing anything else. So I started from scratch, got used to the Android environment and made a lot of mistakes. Since I was the only person handling it, many bugs were found in the first version which took about 2 months(as I was completing my Masters along with the project).

For this project I had to work with brain images which were in 3D and hence difficult to visualize. The segmentation was done using a deep learning architecture called U-Net. U-Net had previously only been used for segmentation of 2d images. And other architectures used for 3d image segmentation only gave little accuracy. Hence I decided to proceed with implementing a 3d version of u-net and faced many challenges during the process such as adapting the fundamental equations to adapt to a 3d image, implementing the network in tensorflow,etc . The project was completed in a period of 1 month in a semester when I was also taking an advance course . The time constraint coupled with technical level of the project made it very challenging new skills and frameworks such as tensorflow, using visualization tools ,etc  easy to read its very close to plain spoken english doesn't feel like programming sometimes opportunity to learn more skill Scala, Node.js, Solidity I think of it as very necessary for my career hence proceed forward Node.js Html Bootstrap Android Mysql yes currently on f1 opt stating july 2 yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravnadkar/, https://github.com/gmn1995 okay\"},\n",

Qooley is a small startup working on mobile travel apps that will be later launched on ios and andriod . Besides my software development internship at Qooley, most of my software engineering experience comes from my many projects done in my time at Turing school of Software & Design. There I dove deep in various web technologies, Object-Oriented Programming, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Sinatra, SQL, Active Record, HTML, CSS and of course Git and GitHub. I learned to work collaboratively with my team remotely via Slack and in person in different pairing styles like driver-navigator and ping-pong. The recent project I worked on from beginning to end was BayCycles. BayCycles is a Ruby on Rails web app that utilizes ActiveRecord to parse through SF Bay Area Bike Share data. In this project, a station has many trips and trips have many weather conditions. Upon signing up, a user can view data analytics. Each station, trip, and condition page has a built-in form where a user can create their own. Additionally, we built an online commerce platform that allows for users to purchase items. A visitor can locate the store by clicking the link the bike share header. I learned to utilize ActiveRecord methods to efficiently query, calculate and report on information in the database. I learned about gems like Paperclip for our images and Rspec formatting gems to make test-driven development more fun and easier to read.  Ruby is what I use the most. Ruby error messages are more descriptive which is very helpful when you like to test-drive your development as I do. I like to work for a company that values continuous improvement and knowledge sharing. Somewhere that understands their employees are never done learning or improving. I would like to learn more JavaScript, Express, React and React Native. I like to practice something new frequently. Taking a few hours a week to watch online course videos and practicing it on my own is entertaining, it's always rewarding to already be familiar with something you could later help someone else with when they need assistance.

The complexities ranged from customizing the java application to suit different customer needs. For example, some customers relied heavily on on-demand conferences, whereas others wanted a recurring reservation pattern (weekly, monthly, etc). Recently, I've been working on setting up and installing a failover mechanism for one of our clients that uses our java application. the requirements were to design to virtual machines or servers that would automatically switch from the primary to the secondary seamlessly. My role was to use NeverFail software and set up the networking channels, install the tomcat and java application software, as well as the SQL Server database. Then, I used NeverFail interface to monitor those services and notify the user in the event of a failure, or automatically switch over to the secondary machine. Sure. I learned a good bit of recovery and failover software processes. I also learned a little bit of DNS network setup and service monitoring. Additionally, I can now write better batch processes  PYthon is very easy to learn and understand. I like that I can automate tasks with it. I created a program that parses logfiles and extracts errors and reports them to the user. It is high-level and robust at the same time!

I learn from projects and code that others have developed and I try to create applications that I can use personally. I think it depends on the project.

While all roles had their differences, customer success is always at the forefont. at a high level yes   yes While at Vital Proteins we used sales force CRM software to gather metrics, customer analytics, etc to get a greater idea of our consumer and the best methods of interaction. However, we inevitable phased out the software and developed a customized portal. Leading with education and a positive approach is my management philosophy. Knowing the 'why', and creating a route from that starting point has been a great lesson. With customer support teams, there can be times when the energy may become dull due to the nature of the department- complaints, concerns, etc. Taking time to see the positives, and recognizing teammates does a lot to boost morale. While managing the customer advocacy team at Vital, it was high stress as the company was scaling so fast. End of day check-ins worked well to hear everyone's grievances, and start the next day on positive footing. A milestone would be gaining placement in large national retailers like Anthropologie and Nordstrom. Leading a team that helped put a tasting menu presentation together took a great deal of planning in terms of logistics and education. By delegating tasks and trusting my teams ability we were able to be successful. Organization is key! Calendars and spreadsheets are essential to not only keep track, but schedule follow-ups. Two week post purchase check-ins are an appreciated KPI. Checking in with a customer to see how they are enjoying the product, how it is selling, if they have questions,etc. showcases your caring approach to the relationship and instills trust.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Ok! My entire career has been in customer service, in one way or another. I spent about 6 years working in Hospitality with a majority of that time spent with Marriott. I grew a very solid foundation of customer service skills working for this company and have continued to utilize that training throughout my career. After working in the hospitality industry, I completely pivoted to a tech startup where I was an Account Consultant, helping service customers and their web based businesses. After spending a couple of years there, I did leave the company because there were no growth opportunities at the time. I ended up getting a teaching position in China and uprooted myself for a year of teaching and travel throughout Asia. When I came back, I jumped right into the tech start up scene again with a position at Belly Card where I was a part of the 7-11 team. I had my hand in a lot of different projects and support aspects there before I was laid off. Following that I was at another start up in the commercial cleaning industry as an Account Manager as well as Operations Manager. And now to my current role at Snapsheet where I have been for almost 2 years. I'm currently a Customer Success Manager for our Inbound call team, as well as manage 4 of our other managers. No. I do not have direct experience with marketing technology. No I started my career in the Hotel industry. When I moved into tech it was with SingleHop, which sells servers. At Belly Card we sold a tech platform for digital loyalty. At OfficeLuv we had a tech solution for office supply replenishment and cleaning services. At SnapSheet we have a tech platform to expedite the claims process for auto accidents.  The ease of being able to house all of a clients information in one spot, including email communications, appointment dates, and services they are subscribed to. It's a great one-stop-shop for their data. I am very proud of the team I'm currently coaching. It's a team of 15 individuals who service our incoming call volume to the company. It can be a high stress position due to the volume of calls we service, and not knowing the nature of what that inbound call is going to entail. I had the opportunity of launching our very first inbound team last summer, and am incredibly proud to be able to look back and see where we are today because going in we didn't know what to expect. It took a lot of trial and error to understand how we needed to service our customers, how many agents we needed staffed, and what specific phone Q's we needed to add. Those that helped in it's launch knew going in that it was going to be kind of crazy, but we knew that together we'd get through it. And we did. Today we have built out better processes surrounding what our Inbound team looks like and the service that we give to our customers. We have the highest QA scores amongst the rest of the organization, and that is something that I take great pride in. That I am able to give them the support that they need to be successful, and that I can coach to our quality standards. I liken customer retention to employee retention. Even your top performers need to have the same touch points as your low performers, because once you get comfortable and think they're solid with where there at, that's when the problems start. It's important to make sure that metrics are in place for each account, growth milestones, and to have proper communication cadence in place to stay ahead of the ball. I think it's important for a customer to feel like you are their go-to person, and that they can trust you. At the end of the day, we are all humans, and making that human connection with a client is going to do wonders for the overall health of the account. The most important thing is having tools in place to be able to do my job well. One of the most challenging things that I currently go through is not having those tools, and trying to make the best out of what I do. For example, there are a lot of inconsistencies with data which makes it difficult for us to be able to forecast accurately for business needs. Oftentimes when going through employee reviews, the tools we have to support their performance is lacking. Additionally, clear growth and variety in work is very important to me. I want to be with a company for a long time and be able to progress - not just into different roles, but have exposure to more challenging work.

With integrations and an inward flow of data, Salesforce can be used to monitor the health of a given client or segment at any given time.  The user friendliness of the reports and dashboards give internal users great insight to where the clientbase stands at any given moment i currently lead 2 cross-functional teams (5 client success managers, and 5 Field Service reps) that have worked together to hit our retention and sales metrics.  I'm proud of the fact that we've built this from the ground up.  This Client Success function didn't exist prior to my arrival and retention was low.  We've been able to come in and turn around the customer sentiment, keep people on the platform, and we grew the existing client base by over 10% last year. In order to retain clients, it's important to make sure that they are using and getting value out of the system.  I look at things like how many people are using the product at a given client, who sees the data, how often, how many different departments are seeing value - how deep are our roots.  It's important to track how they are using the system, are they using it at a very basic level, do they have all the bells and whistles, are they using the system in the way it was designed, are they engaging in feedback loops to constantly improve the product.  I also like to take into consideration things like contract growth, NPS, and satisfaction scores as well as client side parameters like POC turnover, executive turnover, and overall company health.  When any of these things change, there is a playbook for what happens to make sure that everything gets back in balance. I'm looking for a great, stable company that client-centric and understands that Customer Success isn't just a role, but a company mindset.

In 2000 I took a position with Wireless retail as an implementation manager, and in that role I worked with employees in five state region teaching best customer service practices and working to staff out locations with the best candidates available. In 2010 I embarked on a career path in higher education as an admissions advisor, the role of admissions advisor requires one to have excellent customer service and relationship building skills while being able to gain an understanding of client needs and being able to articulate a path to help them reach career and life goals. I followed that path to Career Education Corporation, and then on the Adler University where I has able to add to my skill set and learn how to best meet customer need. The career experience in addition to my educational background in business management have allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the customer success field, while learning how to be effective in leadership and helping to train and inspire others to work as a team to reach organizational goals. Yes  I like that Salesforce is a custom designed CRM that is implemented with the specific needs of the organization that is using it.

The last team I lead was with Career Education Corporation where I functioned as a department lead, my specific team consisted of eight advisors and I was tasked with developing best practices that lead to the better handling of leads, timely follow up, and superior customer service. We were able to routinely hit our monthly enrollment targets and stand out among other teams that we were compared to. I am most proud of the camaraderie that we developed as a team, and the way we were able to utilize the talents of each team member to meet our goals. My approach to managing customer health is the building of relationships with the customers we interact with, many times the area of opportunity that is missed is building the necessary rapport with the client base. It is imperative that the customer can feel that the person(s) that they are interacting with has a genuine care for them and the service that they are being provided. Metrics are key, measuring factors like customers contacted in a work day, timely follow up, and product knowledge all lead to good customer health. Ultimately thins factors can be positively effected by leaders paying attention to detail, and taking time to cultivate and develop their team.

It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table. As I've said, my most recent project was the reimbursement site. I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked. I've learned about how to use servlets and AJAX calls to get databases and websites working together, and how to connect to databases from Java. I've also learned that JavaScript can be too lenient for the programmer's own good.  I like that python is relatively simple, but also highly versatile. I also like the dictionary collection type, as i find that the key-value pairings make organizing and retrieving data much simpler (I've got to explore this advantage in detail in an Information Retrieval course I took in Spring). Mostly I'm just happy to have an opportunity to learn more about software development and gain more experience that will help me in the industry. I admit that I am unfamiliar with .Net programs, which I've seen come up on a few job postings, so I feel that it's something I could use. I also would like to learn more about Angular, which I've only touched upon. I feel that it helps when I have some sort of deadline to meet. Say I have a project that requires me to use knowledge I don't have, so I'll try to find examples of that knowledge in action, in pieces if I must, and work from that to get my program working. I admit to being relatively new to full stack, so Maven, AWS, TomCat and Git are all that I'm really familiar with. No Yes www.linkedin.com/in/martin-melody     https://github.com/mmelody588\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Mostly personal projects. I have worked on Python software used in a production phone system. I worked on a project to create a Python program to edit xml tags based on read in csv files to create contact cards for our phone side cars. Working with the lead developer of our phone system he gave me the parameters and test files along with sample output. Working off of this I created the program and tested with different input. I learned how to better work with csv files in Python as I had not done that much before. Definitely useful for future projects going forward.  Python is a great language to use because of its versatility. A chance to grow and learn. SQL and git are the things I would probably most like to learn but any chance to deepen my knowledge is something I will be excited for. There is almost no subject I am not excited and motivated to learn about. The best learning method I have found is asking questions and looking at others' examples. This usually takes the least time and provides a chance to gain understanding from others' experience. I do have some experience with AWS but I am not well versed in full stack development. I would most likely have to defer to others on this front. no yes www.linkedin.com/in/jarret-piper-4bb068155\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': ' I have woked on the server api system. It is to provide RESTful service for front-end applications. I participated in the whole process of development using Spring MVC and MyBatis framework. Then we done the reconstruction with the micro-service architecture using Spring Boot, Spring DATA JPA. The recent project is a telecommunication application. I Programmed back-end frameworks and components of complex applications and RESTful web services. Built modular tools and services for internal use. Key role in the development of the highly distributed, scalable API system in server end. Here are some tasks I finished:\\n• Participated in the whole development process with Spring MVC architecture and MyBatis persistent\\nlayer framework.\\n• Integrated Spring Boot for the micro-service deployment.\\n• Used Spring Cloud for the service discovery, registration and service-to-service calls.\\n• Used Spring Data JPA(Hibernate) and MyBatis for the persistent layer framework.\\n• Integrated OAuth 2 for the authentication and authorization.\\n• Used RabbitMQ for the message queue between micro-services.\\n• Used AWS(Amazon S3) for resource storage.\\n• Developed features in an AGILE team and track process or issues in JIRA.\\n• Designed unit tests, provided documentation, and utilized version control. There are, like REDIS, Rabbit MQ, I learned them and applied to our system.  I use it to do the web pages. Get data form server, display in the pages. Node.js, Mongo DB etc. There are so many skills I want to learn. I like technoloies so I am willing to learn them by myself. Java, RESTful, Spring (MVC, Boot, Cloud, Data, Security, Cache), Hibernate, MyBatis, Struts2, AWS S3, Python, JavaScript, jQuery, AngularJS, HTML5, CSS3, JSP, Tomcat,MySQL, Oracle, Redis Yes I can work 40 hours per week, full-time, for the next 4 years under CPT & OPT. It would be W2 employment. After that, I would need sponsorship. Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/chenglong-li-me',\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" The biggest project that I have worked on would be a collaborative effort that revolved around making a software to provide video rentals A recent project that I worked on from A to Z would be a chat client that was done in Node.js. On the project we were asked to set up different objects for both those chatting and the rooms that they would be entering\\n\\nFrom the beginning, you were only primarily concerned with the people in the chat, them being unique to an array of different javascript users and being contained in their own chat room. Once the functionality was figured out there via different mocha tests, an HTML page was set up to keep track of user logs and to keep it contained within the individual chats. For added fun, we added a feature that would send our location, in much the same way that a real client keeps track of your location The best part of the process was that it was centered around the front end of a Node.js project. Most of the new skills I learned were centered around that framework, with a bit of exposure to jQuery and how to use the fields on the page to extract data to different objects.\\n\\nIn a lot of ways, Javascript and the accompanying technologies are very open-ended to use, but it all seems very portable to since it can function for both personal and enterprise projects  The most ideal thing that I look for with a new opportunity is having the right people in place to help foster my growth as a programmer and more importantly as a problem solver. Too often we get caught up in the great things happening today in technology that we forget that there are small steps to get there that require both discipline and a good frame of mind. So I'd love to just jump in to maintaining projects and learning the right practices from people already there New languages that I would love to learn would be more .NET simply because of the wide number of enterprise places using it, and python since a lot of the math centered functions there would help supplement the mathematics I learned in college\\n\\nAs for tech, Electron, React, and Spring Boot are some of the more bustling things that I would love to take a look at for personal projects At times it is important to take a step back and learn the beginning things from time to time. If you can learn the beginnings of a language or if you can see small demonstrations in action, usually more often than not, the rest comes just as easy, if not faster and you gain additional enjoyment having something concrete to play with With something such as AWS or Maven, the right tool for the job comes down to how you feel you want your data presented. Is it something that can be done in an SQL solution, is the data more dynamic and requiring noSQL solutions such as mongoDB, along with a variety of other data solutions that AWS may include\\n\\nAs for building stuff with maven, those usually come with the basic requirements of a java project. Additional type checking, build tests, simplified database connection and interaction, automation with functions, etc. No Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevin-montano-4b21b9a3/ Thank you\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': ' The biggest software I have worked upon is building the citation feature of the new Lexis Advance application for Lexis Nexis. The most recent project I worked upon was developing a website for my college professor to host the various c# courses he was teaching. The video lectures and the assignments. /The new tech I had to learn and use while building this website was Angular 6, .NET Web API, .NET Entity Framework  I would like the opportunity to come to work and be able to look at the software being used and look for opportunities in which it can be improved upon. I would also like the chance to develop challenging applications with software best practices for the client or parent company. I would love to learn about react js, I would like to learn more about NoSQL. I would also like to work more with Angular. If I got the chance. I believe you always have the time for something as long as you love to do it and software is one of those things for me. The motivation for learning new things with regards to software comes from the fact that software can be used to build or create applications that the touch the lives of many people through the internet. My ideal stack would be Java. It is a mature language and it has been open sourced for a while now thus allowing a nice large community to be formed and the software they build to be compatible with Java. This would provide us the ability to be flexible with our software choices if need be in the future. With regards to the front-end we can use the tried and tested such HTML, CSS, Javascript and their related frameworks. With regards to Javascript right now React can be used if we looking for a more lightweight, option else we can go for Angular. For the relational database, there are a variety of solutions available such as SQL Server, Oracle SQL. I would suggest we use .NET related if we focusing on using Microsft related tech for the most part. Yes but I do not require it immediately. Yes Yes I would require s ponsorship in the future. But Since I am in the starting period of my EAD. I have the ability to wait a while for at least a year or two. Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/vigneshwar-moorthie/ Thank you',\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Well, let me tell a bit about me. I'm a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Computer Science. I believe I can answer this questions of yours based on the projects that I've worked on. To talk about the most complex project, I should tell you about the one that I worked on when I started off my graduate studies. I developed an algorithm to find the shortest path between any 2 stations in New York subway. I had to gather all the maps pertaining to the subway system. And I found out all the junction points where we can make transfers to different lines. I had to make sure that I didn't miss even a single junction point, as that would lead to miscalculations. I applied Dijkstra's algorithm for that project. And I developed the project using Java. But, I tried out other languages to improve my knowledge. Sure.  I like the versatility of the language. One can literally do wonders with Python. It covers various domains that I can work on. And there are so many libraries that make my work easier. I've always searched for new things to learn and challenges to face. The projects that I work on are chosen keeping that in mind. That being said, I'm looking for new opportunities to showcase my skills, solve complex problems and grow along with the organization. There are 2 things that I'd like to try my hands on. One being the different frameworks of Javascript, as there's a plethora out there. And the other being mobile app development: iOS and Android. I've chosen this field as my career because I find it interesting and challenging. I know for a fact that I have to dedicate my life to it if I have to be successful. That being said, I believe one shouldn't search for time or motivation to acquire new knowledge, as it is implicit that one should focus on this at all times. To be frank, I've used Azure more than AWS. However, picking the right tools depends only on 2 factors, according to me. They are: 1.The problem we are dealing with, and, 2. Customer preference I hold an employment authorization and I'm authorized to work for any employer in the US without any restriction. But probably in a few years of time, I'd need sponsorship. So, yes. Yes. I hold an employment authorization and I'm authorized to work for any employer in the US without any restriction. But probably in a few years of time, I'd need sponsorship, as I'm on F1 visa right now. So, yes. Yes. I live in Chicago. Yes, let me paste the links to both the profiles. https://www.linkedin.com/in/koushikraman1 https://github.com/rkoushik93 Sure, that sounds perfect. Looking forward to hearing from you. Does this conversation end here? I guess, it has, already. Thanks for your time. I appreciate this opportunity. Hoping to hearing soon.\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': ' I have worked in a software development company for a year where I had to design software for online banking. Most of my clients were well renounced banks in Nepal. I had to retrieve datas from UI such as android apps with the use of JSON. And manipulate those data into the banks system. So the most resent project I had to work for was another banking system which uses a kind of online payment method which is similar to what PayPal does. Had to incorporate that into online transaction through the bank itself. Retrieving information on the account used to make the purchase and handling data security was something I was in charge of. I learned how to make the system more secured and to decrease the runtime of the program itself so that the process was smooth and had a good flow. I learnt more about restful server while working on this project. I also learnt about the flow towards the backend of the system. I found that the entire task should not fall back on the UI side but also the backend of the system to make the software you have designed more stable and secure.  I like that the code is not as complex to use and in a Linux system it does wonders. I’m all about using c programming on a Linux system but python helped me cut down so much of the coding process because of its features. I’m all about team work and communication when I’m working on a project. I feel like it’s one of the main aspect to help build a company. I also look forward towards proper planning and management while working on a project. In addition to that as technology keeps on updating itself so I feel like it’s important for a company to crate a good learning environment as well. These days I have been wanting to work more on .net. I have heard so much about it and would love to see how it would work with the ideas I have I understand it’s time consuming which is why I tend to do those things on my off time and not on the company’s time. I in person love research work and accruing new knowledge in my free time. It’s kind of an early hobby I acquired as a child. It’s my hobby to look into things and find something interesting to read. I guess my motivation is my willingness to learn more. For me I have mostly worked on Maven then on cloud. I feel like picking out the right tool for the job would depend on what type of features the client want and analyzing what would go well with what the client wants. Yes I’m on OPT right now with STEM extension for two more years so I have a good three years to work in the United States. I would only ask sponsorship from the company if they like the way I work or if they feel like I bring something unique to their team. Yes I don’t have those account.

The secound one is, I'm ceeating a website for a nonprofit organization which has a donate gateway. in addition, it also allows users to register for retreat. I have learned languages like JAVA/J2EE, HTML, CSS, MYSQL. Frameworks and services like spring, hibernate and REST respectively.  I'm using Javascript for validation in my banking app. With javascript, I validate the fields in the banking application. In my second project, I'm using javascript as in validating and connecting on click retreats page to register for retreats. I'm looking my self as a full-stack developer and looking forward to getting new challenging opportunities. Yes, I'm always keen to learn new technologies and new roles and responsibilities. I'm curretnly learning Java framewroks like spring and hibernate which will enhance my technical expertise in future. I am a constant learner all my life and wanted to be in the future as well. Yes, I agree to learn new things require time but we have 24 hours in a day. I'll cut short my personal routine and will study in that time. I'll choose the right tool based on the requirements and will also keep the points in mind: 1. focus on the business pain points, 2. I'll keep in mind about the Sercurity as it is the biggest concern, 3. I'll also pay attention to the financial model. Yes Currently, I'm on OPT EAD that doesn't require any sponsorship for 3 years but after that to continue working i would reuire H1B sponsorship in future.

       "  'applicant_replies': \"Hi Abby  the biggest software project I worked on was an application that detects cheating for the online card game Hearthstone and also allows users to set up tournaments between other players. In terms of complexity, I would rate it a 6/10 (10 being extremely complex and 1 being trivial). The project previously stated was the most recent project I have worked on, and it was an application aimed at competitive users of the popular online card game Hearthstone. I worked with a group of 5 peers. First, I made the project specifications and design. Then, I broke my team up into smaller groups to focus on front and back end. I ended up joining the back end team. I was responsible for setting up certain tables for our database to hold both user and deck information. I then wrote the code for the API that interacted with our server in order to process commands on the user side. I forgot to mention the testing aspect of the process, in which I wrote code in order to test as many lines of written code as possible. I had to learn Javascript (enough to get the application done) to make this application possible. Another aspect I learned about making software is the planning that needs to be done beforehand, such as specification and design documents. I also learned how to communicate and work with others to meet deadlines.  C; Funny thing is I don't prefer C (I actually kind of dislike it), I just learned it in school enough to complete certain applications. The most important thing I am looking for in a new opportunity is a place that will both teach and push me to master my programming skills (especially Java), while at the same time producing real world applications used on a daily basis. I would like to learn how to program mobile applications for both Android and IOS. I find the time because it is usually easy to find an hour or two a day in order to learn something new. The motivation is also easy because not only is it fun, but I know the knowledge will only help me in the future and worth my time. I think that would depend on the project at hand. For my project, I worked with the AngularJS stack, utilizing Express and Node.js for database/front-end interaction. Many of the dependencies available helped when it came to the API.

The application is a windows application that help user to change monitors and adjust monitors. First I helped build the UI for the drivers, delivering 2 milestones of features.\\n•\\tHelped and learned about code review processes to ensure high quality code.. i also Worked on part of the core IPC, allowing the new UI in Java to effectively communicate with the C++ driver using JNI  C++ It is more basic language. I need to use garbage collectors, pointers and others that don't exist in Java. Getting my first job I am excited to learn! Python it is getting more and more popular. Many jobs require to know about Python Learning more skill will give me opportunity to advance in my career. First i would think if the job is for the client side programming or server side programming. For client side, HTML, CSS, Javascript will be great for it. For server side, java ruby phython, MySQL and others will be great. no yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruicongchen/ thanks\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Alright. I was born and raised in Chicago. I'm a recent computer science graduate of Northeastern Illinois University, and I'm excited to start working in the field. I currently work in a supervisor position at Northeastern, but we have prepared someone to fill my role here so I can move forward with my career in software development, which I'm very excited to do. I love logic and math, which made computer science my natural calling. The most recent project I did was a web app that would allow someone to generate an over the top Hip Hop album cover. I started with a basic wireframe, then created mockups for each page with Adobe Illustrator. Then, I moved on to actually coding it. The end result consisted of a an image, with a few backgrounds to cycle through, and a bunch of small icons that could be endlessly dragged and dropped on to the image, as well as two fields to enter an artist name and album title, which would be displayed over the image and dragged objects. I had a lot of fun making it. When I started the project, I had no idea how deep the capabilities of draggables and droppables was. I had to learn a lot about those to get that functionality working.  I love how readable it is, the syntax is so common sense, and it always looks clean and organized. Learning opportunities. I want to expand my skillset and stay up to date with emerging technologies. Right now I'm looking forward to learning the GO programming language I want to learn GO, it seems like it will be very useful in the coming years. I want to be more hands on with automation. I want to make some functional tools with raspberry pi as a hobby. It comes natuarally. I'm always at my computer at home, poring over new information, whether I'm hopping around wikipedia articles or I like Maven for its directory structure. It keeps everything organized neatly for larger projects. No Yes No\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" The biggest project software project I've worked on is a game project currently under development by myself and 3 other associates. I am one of 2 primary programmers on the job, the other programmer being in charge of determining what we need, and myself primarily filling in those needs. The last project I was present for from beginning to end is a front-end design for a UX course. I, along with 2 others, were responsible from coming up with an application idea and implementing the agile process to get a prototype finished and polished. Being more hands-on that conceptual myself, I took responsibility for translating our needs into designs, and our designs into a program. The software accommodates enough cases that, should it be turned into a fully function application, there is minimal work needed to address an overall diverse user base. I learned a lot about prototyping software, and how it differs from other types of design software, as well as typical programming languages or IDEs. Beyond learning the ways in which a design should be both indicative of a purpose and functional to meet that end, I also learned a lot about working on a team where there are multiple types of tasks that need to be divided up. Prior experiences with teams were moreso about 4 people solving the same task together, as opposed to multiple people solving individual tasks to bring one larger project to life.  The chance to learn and grow around people who actually want me to learn and grow. I always strive for new experiences to come with knowledge and ideas that I can take away with me afterwards. While grinding away at a task just to get it done is entirely functional, I think that as an individual, I can both gain more and, subsequently, contribute more if I have room to improve and am encouraged to do so. I want to learn more about data transfer -- the way in which data moves from software to software, hardware to hardware, machine to person, and vice versa. Data itself is an abstract and system-agnostic thing, so the act of moving it between different mediums has always fascinated me, and I think a world where we welcome a more fluid transfer of data is a world that will learn and evolve a lot faster, and be more well-informed along the way. In terms of languages behind this, I suppose this primarily encompasses network-related frameworks. Well, as I mentioned in an earlier response, I try to make every experience into a learning experience. Surely there are times where the necessary thing is to just do a task the way it's always been done, but when it comes to problem solving, which is what programming is at its core, there's always room for something novel. I don't agree that learning needs to be time consuming, at least in a way that detracts from the primary tasks at hand. It's all about how you approach work itself, and that goes beyond programming. There's always room for something new, working and learning do not need to be exclusive. I have no prior experience with stacks, but given my current knowledge and skills, I'd likely go for MEAN. No. Yes. https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-cho-67299112a/ thanks.\",\n",

More information about the project can be found on Github: https://github.com/aquddus95/E-Commerce I worked on a Restaurant Search engine project where I was responsible for the front and back end development. The project consisted of integrating reviews from Yelp and Zomato (retrieved by using the companies respective APIs) . More information about the project can be found on https://github.com/aquddus95/API-Integration I did have to learn the front end portion on the fly. Learning how to use front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap.  Ability to write an application in python at times take a lot less to code in comparison to other languages such as C/ C++ The ability to learn new technologies and apply them in a productive manner I would like to learn C#/ .Net and more about AWS What motivates me to learn new languages is the fact that I can use these languages to help create new applications which may have been very difficult to do with the languages that I already know I would pick tools based on the requirements of the projects. So if tools like AWS would be more efficient to implement the project then I would prefer conducting the project in AWS in comparison to Maven and likewise for the reverse situation.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" In terms of complexity, I can think of a project I've worked on with Spring and Hibernate in 2014. The telecommunication domain application helps business associates to refer how long does the provisioning of a service takes to assist them with actual customer ordering. The challenge was to create a ruling engine based on the different types of requirements and parameters. The same can be done with a messy complex logic or with an efficient rule based engine we deployed. The combination of rules are embedded as database entries and the variations of the rules will be evaluated by querying out and outputing the value, instead of endless conditional expressions. The recent project could be the one when I was with Inference Analytics on Spring 2018, the requirement was to deploy predictive healthcare models on AWS. The predictive model built by machine learning algorithms are converted into python pickle for serialization. The prediction happen when an end user input values and the model spits out the most accurate prediction. A rest web service in python flask is created which accepts the values and outputs the predictions. An appropriate web interface in HTML, CSS, JavaScript , jQuery, AJAX is created where the users can input the values and call for the web service. A restricted user login is provided for the web interface with python flash hashing method. The whole application is packaged using docker and released into ElasticCloud AWS I learned docker, pickling and AWS.  Well, I've been using javascript for quite few years along with Java, the field is vibrant with always new libraries being released. I wish to learn more about node.js, vue.js very soon. I wish to work on Java8 Lambdas, maybe on spring security too. There are so much to learn always, and especially in technology a new release or change occurs every time. I do not want to stay behind when everyone is moving forward. I always invest my time and looking for opportunities where I can learn always something new, and if even if the technology is not new, working with one another person makes you learn something everyday. I'm equally interested in Maven and AWS. Maven I've worked on projects with Spring and Spring Boot. And AWS is a refreshing new approach with lots of support and an ever growing community. I'll pick based on the current project setup, usability, support, cost. I choose the best option summing up all the weights. Yes I'm on F1 OPT, which allows work authorization for three years. I need H1B sponsorship if need to continueaftwerwards Yes psindhu https://www.linkedin.com/in/pinkys/ https://github.com/psindhu Sure. Thank you!\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Sure I would say the biggest software project I worked on was in my current project at NIPSCO. The project titled nipsrate was designed specifically for the company's Industrial customers. These were huge conglomerates and manufacturing companies the utility serves to. The project would allow them to give an interface on how they would be handling their energy needs. The live EMS/Scada data was fed into the application and the application would reflect it in terms of MW consumed by the consumer. The appliation had a feature to forecast their energy needs based on previous consumption and predict live data. A key feature of the appliaction was messaging. We used ActiveMQ built on JMS and Topics for a publisher subscriber model and Queues for a point to point model. I worked on the ActiveMQ from scratch The company though huge and serves over to 400,000 consumers for their electricity needs. The IT team was relatively small and we had to bridge the gap of Business Analysts, we the team(6 people with 3 developers) would directly interract with the production managers gaining valuable business skills. We were involved in deploying the application on the servers too, using load balancers, procuring servers thus bridging the gap of the Operational Team too. It was a very goid learning experience. The application in itself involved heavily on  Spring MVC, RESTful webservices, Spring IOC, Spring Security, JPA, Hibernate ORM, Oracle DB, ActiveMQ, HandsonTables, Json data processing, JSP, JavaScript,Mustache Js  Yes JavaScript is very lightweight and helps in reducing the redundancy in the server calls. My ideal role would be a FullStack Java Developer role with a focus on backend. I have used Spring Boot and Spring MicroServices and they really help in transforming the Applications Performance and is a developer's dream. The spring framework speaks to me. Learning and growing in my career would be the role Im looking for .net I want to bridge the gap between the java and .net languages and be agile to either Deducation and motivation is the key So my ideal stack would be using a good build tool like Maven or Gradle. Build the Appliaction using Spring, Spring MVC,Spring Security,Spring Boot,SpringMicroservices, and using a cloud based environment to deploy and  make changes on the fly. Netflix OSS is really good. No, I would need the client to be able to transfer my H1 visa Yes H1B I would like the client to be able to transfer it from my employer Transfer Yes Linkedin is under process https://www.linkedin.com/in/aneesh-ankem-b22b9715a/ Ok thanks Robot\",\n",

I always try to keep myself updated. My resume shows I have worked on different technologies. That is to show I love to learn and work on different tech stacks depends on the requirement actually. If data is that huge and needs storage is really required then AWS would be necessary and the kind of data storage would let me choose No SQL or SQL DB. yes I am on opt ead i would need h1b after 3 years yes https://github.com/prat-511 Ok!',\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" The biggest project that I've so far participated in was a class scheduling system that I helped design and develop over the course of a semester of my junior year in college. Although not actively used, we put a lot of effort into making the interface as usable and friendly as possible. Addionally we used command pattern throughout the project. Again, the above is my best example. We started with requirement elicitation, use cases, class diagram, etc. After that we made a framework for the program's structure with command pattern in mind. Before we began the actual process of coding, we pre-wrote all of the required tests for every function. During delvelopment, we frequently checked in with the customer (the professor) to make sure things were progressing as desired. Command pattern, the idea of pre-writing tests before coding begins and it was my first time going through the whole process of agile development.  C++ and C#. I like both with a preference towards C#. I like to think that C# feels like Java with the power of C++ behind it. Feels smooth, clean and fast. Additionally, C# can be used in a lot of places Java or C++ might not be able to be used, like webpages. I'd rather like to be in a position where I can have some sort of positive effect on people through the software I help develop. I'd like to learn more about AI and just programming in general. It's an ever changing field and that what I like about it, you can't stop learning. Usually I learn new things as they come up. I like to think that Google has been my best teacher. There's always a better solution, so I search it out and learn as much as I can along the way. This allows me to connect ideas together in new ways and apply them. To be honest, I'm not familiar with those tools. However that doesn't mean I cannot learn. If I were to be thrown into a situation where I'd have to use them, I'd ask. I'd ask the people who know better than me. I can't know everything, and neither can anyone else, but by asking I can at least learn from them to make better decisions in the future.

I am very much interested to learn Python for machine learning and AWS. I always study for at least 2-3 hours at night and i use that time for learning the language of my passion. And the main source of motivation is the things that goes daily around the world. the new developements that comes in the news paper. the main idea behind using any tool is the importance and usefulness of the product. So When I use spring like things, I use Maven as it is the main tool for automatic ;configuring the dependencies. Similarly, AWS has also its own role .

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I have worked on health care systems for British Columbia and Missouri during my time at RedMane Technology. I do not know the exact figures. Earlier this year I developed a predictor for March Madness. It's a statistical analysis project written in Python. I first decided which data I would use and some ideologies that I wanted the model to keep true to. I then wrote the data collector and then the first version of the model itself. The predictor failed to meet expectations for the most recent tournament based on historical results. I realized some of the data I'm using includes tournament results and biases the model towards teams that did well in the tournament. Work on the predictor is ongoing with hopes to improve results for the next tournament. This project was my first foray into statistical analysis, so I learned about some of the Python libraries used in that.  I like that it's easy to jump into. You can start a project very easily, while still having access to many powerful libraries. I also enjoy the style of writing in Python. The most important thing that I'm looking for is that doing the work is interesting. More so than the end product, I want to enjoy the process of getting to the end product. I would be excited to learn anything new. I take pride in my ability to learn and use a variety of languages. My motivation to acquire new knowledge is simply to have that knowledge. I wouldn't say I have an ideal stack. The tool that I pick for a job is usually the one that I'm currently interested in learning more about. No Yes https://github.com/dldobbin ok\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \"Hi Abby the 'I am ready' button?  I worked with a team to go live with the Hybris eCommerce platform, which includes stabilizing the order flow from the platform into the SQL database, update existing legacy systems to support platform's newer functionality, and implement data feed to send customer, user, product, and pricing to the platform in timely manner. Currently, we're working on project to migrate customers from our existing legacy into the Hybris platform. Recently, I had to add fields to an view for the SAP Sql Business Objects app. I look over the request, realized that the request was older, and newer fields were added to primary table since the request was submitted. I followed up with business analyst to confirm names, and add the newer fields not previously on the request. Gotten approval, compiled changes in test environment, and ran both Unit and regression tests. Upon completion, moved changes to preprod environment for business analyst for final review. At same time, coordinated with another engineer to add fields directly in Business Objects so that business analyst can review. Analyst approved changes and currently scheduled for upcoming code deployment by separate deployment team. Once deployed, analyst will do final validation in production and give signoff. I improved my communication skills with business analyst, & BO engineer. Ensuring both of them understand what changes are needed for go live. Also, improved my coordination in that I was able to get the engineer to implement the changes on their side in timely manner to get business signoff.  Continued growth as engineer, to eventually become a full stack engineer. I would to be more hands on with Java, .Net, and JavaScript. As far as learning new languages, I would love to learn Python. Best way I've learned is to adapt a project, and use the languages to build upon that. For expanding on Java, i'm building a PDF generator program. Based on preface and experience, I would prefer working on Java stack, specifically Spring. No Yes Here's my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisdiaz1066/. thank you, abby\",\n",

As well as connecting to the external storage brokering system, Apache Kafka. I learned about different ways to store large data sets and mostly core Java application service skills.  Its similarity for Java! My next opportunity should be with a technology stack I like, i.e. Java, C#, Spring, .NET that sort of deal. I've always felt Python scripting would be an exciting challenge for me but I've never been in a structured enough environment to really get dirty with it. There is a lot of time in the day if you manage it carefully. One tip I've learned is to manage time by minutes not by the hour. I use this productivity in any work environment. I'd feel most comfortable working with a Maven build on Spring Framework just generally because that's where my experience has been thus far. I'm always open and willing to hear the advantages of other approaches because there is a lot I know I have still yet to learn. No Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/shoeb-mohammed-a51393105/ OK\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': ' I was working as a Research Assistant in my undergraduate college in India where I was told to create a project called - Multilingual Document Clustering of Newspaper articles. I had to use Hadoop, AI techniques like SVM, Particle Swarm Optimization(Genetic algorithm), Fuzzy C-Means, core Java, NLP techniques to clean and prepare(tokenize) newspaper articles from multiple languages and to convert them to English. \\n\\nIn short, the task was to collect newspaper articles from 3 languages, convert them to English and create a mini search engine which will find the documents and then redirect to its origin language. Since there were many articles, I had to use Hadoop. The most recent project that I handled all by myself was an Android app. One day I had an idea - how about we create a summary of a journey from point A to point B without the user doing anything else. So I started from scratch, got used to the Android environment and made a lot of mistakes. Since I was the only person handling it, many bugs were found in the first version which took about 2 months(as I was completing my Masters along with the project). The biggest hurdle was to create a video illusion using programming given that I have all co-ordinates of that vehicle/person from point A to point B and I didn\\' I am completing the last answer here. \"find anything online. So using multithreading, I was somehow able to create the video from co-ordinates. Also, the app captues all the images, video and notes that you take along the way from point  A to B. So if you ever want to know what you did on your trip on a given day and all the photos and videos you took on that trip, you can use this app. Its on Play Store with the name - Listory\". Coming to this question - My main aim of Masters and to come to US was to get accustomed to AI/Machine Learning. SO in the past 2 years I took 8 out of 10 courses in ML/AI. It was challenging in the beginning but I got the hold of it by the end as new frameworks seem to pop out everyday and its not worth it to learn each one. However, I achieved what I wanted - to understand under the hood workings of AI and its use in real life applications  Because its compact and its usually the language of AI frameworks, however there are Java frameworks too I am a recent graduate, but I want to learn as much as possible and take on responsibility along with a little guidance from the experienced coders. My primary preference would be Java/Spring Software/Web or Angular Front-end Also, I would be requiring H1-B visa sponsorship, I hope thats not a problem. Sure, I am always in to learn new languages. As of now, I can code professionally in Java, Python, C++, C# along with novice experience with Ruby, Kotlin I am 25, got my whole life ahead of myself. SO you tell me In terms of cloud, its AWS of course, I have only used Maven in Java Spring projects. In terms of Web, I have mostly used MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) Stack. Yes I am from India, completed my Masters and looking for a Full-time job. So initially I will be on OPT visa i.e. for 1+2(Extension) = 3 years of OPT, and after or around the end of my 1st year, I shall be applying for H1-B visa which gives 6 more years of job visa.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I worked on a Job matching website where we had to be able to accept job seekers, company and recruiter accounts.  Each account type had its own set of available tasks from searching for jobs to creating positions available for hire.  It also relied on a nueral network to match jobs to applicants that fit with the role. Recently I worked on a project that searched the ticket master API for events in a given location and allowed the user to filter through the events.  It was made using Angular and relied on a flask backend to search the API.  We first created the Angular frontend with test data to make sure the application had a usable interface, then created the flask backend to be able to handle the API calls and pass over the data. That project introduced me to Angular and allowed me to understand how to create a usable web application.  I also learned CSS, HTML and Javascript during that project to use in the Angular platform.  I like how much universal utility that Python gives and all the various packages and open source code available.  It makes it extremely easy to use for almost any type of project or application. The most important thing to me is the opportunity to use all of my current coding skills along with be given new challenges and the ability to learn. Ruby and Javascript are languages I would like to use more, but any language I can get more professional experience. I work on projects in my spare time and always try and use a language or platform I haven't used before to try and get more experience with as many languages as possible.  My goal is to make myself versatile and give myself the ability to use anything that's put infront of me. I feel like the ideal stack depend on the development team and their strengths.  I tend to use Django and Python because I have used them and have the most knowledge about what they offer, but if more of the team has knoweldge in a different stack then it would be better for me to learn that stack since I can pick up new tech quickly.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I had worked on a academic project of cross lingual search engine I had worked on White matter hyperintensities (areas of high internsity on MRI scans of human brain) segmentation which was my most challenging project till date. For this project I had to work with brain images which were in 3D and hence difficult to visualize. The segmentation was done using a deep learning architecture called U-Net. U-Net had previously only been used for segmentation of 2d images. And other architectures used for 3d image segmentation only gave little accuracy. Hence I decided to proceed with implementing a 3d version of u-net and faced many challenges during the process such as adapting the fundamental equations to adapt to a 3d image, implementing the network in tensorflow,etc . The project was completed in a period of 1 month in a semester when I was also taking an advance course . The time constraint coupled with technical level of the project made it very challenging new skills and frameworks such as tensorflow, using visualization tools ,etc  easy to read its very close to plain spoken english doesn't feel like programming sometimes opportunity to learn more skill Scala, Node.js, Solidity I think of it as very necessary for my career hence proceed forward Node.js Html Bootstrap Android Mysql yes currently on f1 opt stating july 2 yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/gauravnadkar/, https://github.com/gmn1995 okay\",\n",

I want to expand my knowledge that I have as an automation engineer. Learning new languages is always great. Helps explore out the box. I learn pretty quickly.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" This biggest software I've had the honor of helping out with is the Qooley apps. Qooley is a small startup working on mobile travel apps that will be later launched on ios and andriod . Besides my software development internship at Qooley, most of my software engineering experience comes from my many projects done in my time at Turing school of Software & Design. There I dove deep in various web technologies, Object-Oriented Programming, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, RSpec, Sinatra, SQL, Active Record, HTML, CSS and of course Git and GitHub. I learned to work collaboratively with my team remotely via Slack and in person in different pairing styles like driver-navigator and ping-pong. The recent project I worked on from beginning to end was BayCycles. BayCycles is a Ruby on Rails web app that utilizes ActiveRecord to parse through SF Bay Area Bike Share data. In this project, a station has many trips and trips have many weather conditions. Upon signing up, a user can view data analytics. Each station, trip, and condition page has a built-in form where a user can create their own. Additionally, we built an online commerce platform that allows for users to purchase items. A visitor can locate the store by clicking the link the bike share header. I learned to utilize ActiveRecord methods to efficiently query, calculate and report on information in the database. I learned about gems like Paperclip for our images and Rspec formatting gems to make test-driven development more fun and easier to read.  Ruby is what I use the most. Ruby error messages are more descriptive which is very helpful when you like to test-drive your development as I do. I like to work for a company that values continuous improvement and knowledge sharing. Somewhere that understands their employees are never done learning or improving. I would like to learn more JavaScript, Express, React and React Native. I like to practice something new frequently. Taking a few hours a week to watch online course videos and practicing it on my own is entertaining, it's always rewarding to already be familiar with something you could later help someone else with when they need assistance. Java with Maven or Spring. Spring is said to be the top web framework but Maven is the most popular build tool for Java, so finding support is easier to find.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I've created a series of scripts for my job at Medline Industries. It involves over 300 lines of code and has many different functionalities, including: adaptable screenshots, deleting items from a database that's read off Excel, and organizing data. It was a series of scripts created in AutoHotKey. I wrote the scripts in Notepad since the computer I was using didn't have any IDEs. I made a different script for each functionality, then ran a main script to run each script based on which job I had to complete. I learned how to better organize my code, and how to better utilize AutoHotKey, especially for operations needing the use of mouse coordinates.  I use C# for game programming in Unity, and use AutoHotKey, Bash, and AppleScript for script work. Bash and AppleScript are mainly for Apple computers, while I use AutoHotKey for Windows OS I'm looking for a software development role to learn the ropes of software development, and also to grow as a software developer. I'd like to learn .NET and Javascript. I've always loved learning and problem solving. Whenever I find a new problem that interests me, I don't stop problem solving until I find a solution. I find problem solving a lot of fun, and the fact that I can use computer programming to solve new and unique problems is very exciting to me! I prefer Eclipse, but I'm willing to pick up a new tool to learn and use. No Yes LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-allen-174b03b6/ | Github: https://github.com/aallen170\",\n",

I completed masters in Computer Science and looking for opportunities in Java and Database field. I have hands on experience in developing data structures and algorithms in java and strong knowledge in java development such as JDBC, Servlets, Spring, Hibernate. Also have strong progmming skills in Java, Scala and SQL. Worked on Big Data technologies such as Hive, Spark, Hadoop, Sqoop and Kafka. Experience in working with large size data sets and converting to different file formats. Strong experience in ETL and data warehouse concepts such as Normalization, Denormalization. I'm looking for an opportunity to work as a Software Engineer. I worked for retail client project where the data from different source system is integrated through ETL process by performing data cleansing and data validation. Then the data is analyzed through Big Data tools such as Hive, Pig, Spark to help the customers find their products easily. We also developed Recommendation system using Collaborative filtering mechanism to recommend the most liked products to the users based on their previous historical data. The other project I worked on is developing and designing the ecommerce web application using Java, Spring and Hibernate. This project involves various technologies such as Spring, Hibernate, Java, SQL, Maven, Agile and GIT.  Easily understandable and can develop application with concise code. I'm mainly passionate about working with coding and developing algorithms or application in any technology with any programming language. Currently , I'm learning Scala programming and it's more interesting. I want learn more hand on with scala programming Working late hours is habitable and creates more interest about work. If there is a huge amount of data to compute, definitely AWS is good choice. Yes Currently, I'm on OPT status Yes Github Username : harikrishna1302 https://github.com/harikrishna1302 Sure.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" In terms of complexity, the biggest software project I have worked on is building a Java-based web application when I was at Tata Consultancy Services This application was a finance based application, the main task was to integrate it with a content management system Alfresco, to allow the documents to be stored electronically and to allow these documents to be available for download globally.. I learnt coding in Core Java, Spring Framework, building REST API's, I also got to work on the backend, thereby learning PL/SQL and PostgreSQL  I am looking for some opportunity that would challenge me put my skills to best use and also learn new cutting edge technologies like Cloud-based. Yep, I'd like to learn more of AWS or Hadoop I solve online coding problems to keep my interest in learning new stuff alive.. It keeps new learning interesting as well, as I love to be challenged I am comfortable working with Maven, Jenkins and servers like Weblogic, Tomcat or JBoss. I would like to learn more about AWS, as I am practicing that on my own right now. Okay Yep, I do need sponsorship. I am currently on OPT visa. Yep, Chicago is perfect location for me as I am based out of Chicago Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/rimpy-tewani/ Sure.Thanks. Good day!\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': ' I currently work for University of North Texas. I have built spring Mvc applications here to enable students learn online courses efficiently.. I also manage their databases and do the general migration every semester from between test and production servers. Recently I have worked on migrating the old personalized online courses to Canvas LMS. I have handled this project all alone. I have written api calls using Node Js that connects university database with Canvas database. There were various templates that needs to be moulded so that they fit in Canvas. This was my recent project. Node Js, Rest Api , Canvas LMS, asynchronous programming  As said earlier, I have used Node Js for canvas migration project. I am looking for a project that uses latest technologies so that I can learn and perform efficiently using my existing skills. I am good at learning quickly. If I get a chance, I will prefer to work on Big Data projects. During my Masters, I have did Introduction to Big Data course on coursera and it was interesting. Unfortunately, I didnt get chance to work on it in my current job I will look for meetups and read blogs to know whats going on currently. I have worked on Spring MVC, Maven, Hibernate but never got chance to work on AWS. Once, I have helped my friend to get Magento installed on AWS. I am very much longing to work on it. Yes I can work on F1 visa till 2020. But, to continue my work in US I would be needing sponsorship for H1b visa. Yes http://linkedin.com/in/yodhakudumala Great, Thank you!!

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Currently I'm working with Verizon Telematics which is an IoT platform with more than 100 thousand active users. Verizon Telematics is an innovative fleet management software that uses advanced fleet tracking techniques to seamlessly monitor your vehicle. It provides frequent health status updates, emergency services, entertainment etc., using a single cohesive system. It's completely an IoT platform where we are handling huge amount of customer data feeds in real time. We have constructed an ETL pipeline which consumes the data from the IoT sensors and streamline through Kafka with a data retention period of 7 days. The streamlined data is sent to Spark which acts as an analytics engine processing large scale data and storing it in different end points. Both history and real time data feeds are stored in different end points. We have a REST api to service requests for different business logic. The api hits the database to fetch the data requested by a business service to showcase it to the end user using Grafana Dashboard on the web application. I've used frameworks like Spring, Hibernate to build the REST api to serve the incoming requests. I've learned and implemented the docker containers for handling the micro-service architecture. I've got a chance to learn and implement the Kafka cluster for data streaming.  I'm looking forward for a challenging role in the new opportunity. Apart from Full Stack development I'm really interested in working with big data After work I'll do a lot of homework to learn new stuffs to acquire deep knowledge on the technologies I'm working. I'm currently using Maven for handling the software dependencies and build management. I've gained hands-on experience with AWS EC2, S3 and ECS technologies Yes I'm on F1 OPT visa valid till August 2020.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I developed an Inventory for a telecom client when I was working as a systems engineer in Tata Consultancy Services(TCS) in hyderabad, India I developed a spring MVC and Hibernate application to handle a student database with MySql workbench which involves CRUD operations on student information, the courses he enrolled for and the instructor he is assigned to and build the application using maven. To maintain version control and reliability while developing it, I used subVersion(SVN) . I used a designed tool which generates xml schema for the database so that I design in the tool and run the schema in mysql workbench without the need to develop all the database. I felt amused by that. I learned quick design and followed agile process with that.  A good work environment where I developers can communicate with clients if needed to fill the holes, a place with efficient QA team, good interaction with team members and supervisor and an organization which allows professional development of its employees. I am convenient to work as a web developer, software algorithms developer and I can handle little front-end development as well. wordpress, Xampp framework and aws. I am a new-bee with these technologies and learn more and feel comfortable with them. I am open to learn anything as far as it is needed for the work and professional development. I am an efficient learner with deep thought process. I had 2 professional years experience on maven, ant. I am working with AWS right now though I might take a while to get a hold of it. I prefer good interaction with the teammates and design team gives a solution to select the right tool. It's a complication question just to answer a Yes or No. I can work in US for next two years without any sponsorship. If the organization want me for a long time to contribute my work, I need sponsorship by the end of 3rd year. Yes I am a recent graduate and I am in F1-OPT(EAD) status Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/chaitanyarayala/ yeah sure!\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': ' I worked on a project for Ameriprise financial services called TeamConnect which was used by millions of customers of ameriprise financial I recently did a project as a part of my academia, called Click n pick . It was an e-commerce web application for buying out clothing apparels. We made a survey initially from different e commerce clothing web sites and then decided on the functionality and design of the project . WE were a team of four and divided the work among us. I got the opportunity to design the front end and working on few of the business logic for adding the items to cart . All four of us had the track of the flow of application and we helped each other in times of an error.We developed our own modules and integrated finally using git and then tested it for the functionalities that we expected and then finally delivered to the department and got good appreciation. I improved on the team working and collaborating skills. Learnt on how to integrating the code in git and managing the conflicts.\\ntechnology wise i learnt XML parsing using sax parser and learnt using mongo DB and json data  want to learn the new technologies in software development and improve my current skills and also a good team. Yes on Rest APi, Spring boot , Micro Services. I will use my free time after my work to learn and update my skills.I always want to be on the front seat to explore new things and keep myself moving forward. Picking the right tool for the job is dependent on the requirements , scalability issues .If we need  high performance computing on need basis , then we prefer on cloud services then our own systems. yes I am currently under Stem OPT. with my OPT i can work for any employer for 3 years but after that for my work authorization i would need H1 B sponsorship yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/vikram-gavisiddeshwara-234924123/ sure',\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I have worked with the companies Infosys and Allstate. In Infosys I worked for the client CVS pharmacy.  I especially worked on the scan based trading system and the promo code generation systems . the scan based trading project is a process where suppliers maintain ownership of the inventory with retail warehouses or stores until items are scanned at point of sale. I made major and minor enhancements to this system . The implementation was in Java, spring MVC, databases such Oraclr. Yes I learnt Spring MVC framework  C++ I worked on a project during my semester course which was 2d game development course in which I built a fully functional 2d interactive game using C++ and it was data driven using xml I wanted to advance more as a backend software engineer . Also I would be happy to learn some new front end technologies as well Yes React React is a java script framework which is really fast for building fast reactive front applications I am always interested in new technologies and always want to update myself with what's new in the market The ideal stack for a scalable applications would be backend server side java web application (with maven dependency management) hosted on AWS using cloud formation. And also having a Application load balancer to manage the distributed traffic loads. Also RDS like mysql or Oracle as the persistence layer. Yes I am currently on my OPT and I have recieved my EAD card and eligible to start working from June 20th 2018. I can work on my OPT for 3 years with an OPT extension but I would be needing a H1B sponsorship to continue working Sure https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashwin-kumar-vajantri-559b1090/\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" During my last work experience I worked on a complex web application built upon the Struts framework. This application was really complex because it used Struts 1.2 and was written about 10 years ago. This application is being by all the 36 independent blue cross blue shield companies. A recent project I worked on from start to finish is my AWS Cloud project. It was a project I did for school. I built a website which converts an uploaded image to B&W by using various AWS components like EC2, Custom AMI, IAM, ELB, Auto Scaling, Launch configuration, SNS, SQS, S3 and RDS. This was hosted in the cloud. Yes I did. Before beginning the project I had very little knowledge about the various AWS components available. After beginning this project I learnt a lot of AWS, it's components, and how to use them. Apart from that PHP was used extensively in this project.  Currently I am looking for a position where I can learn and grow. The position should be challenging and also provide me with opportunities to learn new technologies and languages. Yes, I would love to learn more about front-end technologies like vue.js and react.js. I would also love to learn more about Cloud Technologies since that is what the industry is moving towards now. At the beginning of my internship last year at Blue Cross Blue Shield Association I was given a web application build on Struts 1.2. At that time I did not have much knowledge about the Struts framework. Hence I registered for online courses on Struts and would come home after work and start learning Struts. That is how I coped with something I didn't have much knowledge about. At this day and age I believe one should constantly be learning, without which they will be left behind. I would love to work on projects which is based on Java and AWS. I have worked with both Ant and Maven. Yes I am currently on OPT (F1 visa) and can start working now without sponsorship. But I would require H-1B sponsorship in the future to continue work at your company. Yes LinkedIn :https://www.linkedin.com/in/kapilankumanan Github:https://github.com/kapilank Thanks\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Hi, yes I worked on a reservation scheduling software for conferencing applications in Java. The complexities ranged from customizing the java application to suit different customer needs. For example, some customers relied heavily on on-demand conferences, whereas others wanted a recurring reservation pattern (weekly, monthly, etc). Recently, I've been working on setting up and installing a failover mechanism for one of our clients that uses our java application. the requirements were to design to virtual machines or servers that would automatically switch from the primary to the secondary seamlessly. My role was to use NeverFail software and set up the networking channels, install the tomcat and java application software, as well as the SQL Server database. Then, I used NeverFail interface to monitor those services and notify the user in the event of a failure, or automatically switch over to the secondary machine. Sure. I learned a good bit of recovery and failover software processes. I also learned a little bit of DNS network setup and service monitoring. Additionally, I can now write better batch processes  PYthon is very easy to learn and understand. I like that I can automate tasks with it. I created a program that parses logfiles and extracts errors and reports them to the user. It is high-level and robust at the same time! I am interested in learning new skills, and working with java or python frameworks as a software developer. I prefer a collaborative team environment where I can share and exchange ideas with others. flexibility at work is also nice to have Sure. I have an interest in front-end design and development. I am curious about javaScript frameworks like Angular/React/Vue as well as NoSQL databases like MongoDB and Redis Usually I try to keep up with other developer communities that I subscribe to. I learn from projects and code that others have developed and I try to create applications that I can use personally. I think it depends on the project. If the work requires a quick API interface then I would use Java or python with Postman for testing, and any sort of database in the back-end, depending on performance requirements.

       "  'applicant_replies': ' 18 years Yes   I like the ability to be able to track and organize my customer interactions in a thorough, intuitive manner. I currently lead the sales team at Halo Investing. We have grown our customer base, client usage, conversions and success metrics by significant margins.  I am not only proud of the growth we have achieved but also how much the team has improved and been laser focused on delighting our customers. It is imperative to be in close contact with the senior management team of my clients to obtain feedback on how service delivery is perceived and to identify cogs in the process or areas that need to be approved.  I think it is imperative to be proactive in managing potential issues before they hurt the relationship.  I think it is critical to success that there is someone quarterbacking the key eneterprise relationships and that is proactive in setting expectations, exceeding those expectations and building a solid, concise blueprint for those expectations so that everyone is on the same page and clear in the the growth goals, client satisfaction metrics and that the whole Omni channel client experience is top notch. I am looking for a company with a great culture and people that all are driven to grow together.   I am also looking to be challenged and further grow professionally.

I also have worked in the non-profit industry.  Very user friendly When I did sales selling AT&T products, we used Salesforce to track our leads and our territories. It was very easy to learn and to teach others how to use it. I led a sales team of more than ten people when I worked for Midwest Development Corp. My personal milestone that I hit was being a top five sales person for the AT&T midwest market in door-to-door sales. In terms of my team's milestones, I was most proud when we broke our company record for most new accounts by a team in one week (80 new accounts). Touching base with customers is extremely important. Hearing their concerns and needs allows us to use that info to help with renewals and up-selling. Our relationship with the customer is most important. It must be genuine and all situations must be tackled with enthusiasm. I'm looking for a fun, energetic environment that encourages collaboration and open communication.

Every night I would work with a team of 3-5 serves to ensure that our members were happy with our service. I worked mostly weddings and big events, so just seeing how happy everyone was with their experience made me the happier than I could have imagined I think the best when it comes to managing customer health is to just to prioritize and reduce response time. The customers want to feel valued and the best way to do that is ensure that they are in the right hands and getting the best experience possible Ideally, I would love an opportunity to continuously grow. Whether that be in my skill set or the company. I think both kind of go hand in hand No Yes www.linkedin.com/jocelynbward Thank you! I appreciate it',\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Hi Abby! Customer success has played a large part in my professional background- close to eight years. As an esthetician, a positive customer experience means everything, including repeat income and new customers. At Vital Proteins I began my career as the Customer Advocacy Manager, where I implemented new procedures and built out the entire team. From there, I moved into a sales manager role overseeing all beauty accounts. While all roles had their differences, customer success is always at the forefont. at a high level yes   yes While at Vital Proteins we used sales force CRM software to gather metrics, customer analytics, etc to get a greater idea of our consumer and the best methods of interaction. However, we inevitable phased out the software and developed a customized portal. Leading with education and a positive approach is my management philosophy. Knowing the 'why', and creating a route from that starting point has been a great lesson. With customer support teams, there can be times when the energy may become dull due to the nature of the department- complaints, concerns, etc. Taking time to see the positives, and recognizing teammates does a lot to boost morale. While managing the customer advocacy team at Vital, it was high stress as the company was scaling so fast. End of day check-ins worked well to hear everyone's grievances, and start the next day on positive footing. A milestone would be gaining placement in large national retailers like Anthropologie and Nordstrom. Leading a team that helped put a tasting menu presentation together took a great deal of planning in terms of logistics and education. By delegating tasks and trusting my teams ability we were able to be successful. Organization is key! Calendars and spreadsheets are essential to not only keep track, but schedule follow-ups. Two week post purchase check-ins are an appreciated KPI. Checking in with a customer to see how they are enjoying the product, how it is selling, if they have questions,etc. showcases your caring approach to the relationship and instills trust. General account management principles of: increase current usage, stimulate new users, reduce customer churn provide great guidance at a high level. Monthly and Annual recurring revenue metrics are essential when considering retention from a monetary standpoint as well. I am looking to grow and learn in my career. Working with a company I can expand my skill set with, and stay with for the long term is a goal of mine. I truly enjoy working, and a positive company culture makes it all the more appealing. I appreciate working with a collaborative workforce where no idea is too big or small, but all about the perspective. With a true entrepreneurial mindset, I love being a part of a growing company and taking part in the rewarding hard work.

Based on these KPI's, I am usually putting each customer in one of three tiers - Top Customers, Customers that need to be monitored for drop-off and At-Risk customers.

It allows for the user to store historical information, review past and present case notes, as well as track FCR The last team I lead is my current one.

I have a curious mind so I’m always data mining and use this as one of the main levers in making operational decisions. One of the key metrics I’ve historically coach is SLA. If you’re are within your assigned SLA you can measure your companies ability to service your customer.  The key is to have your agents well trained (and constant refresher trainings ) and ready to service the customers. Growth. Calibration. The ability to ideate.

I am most proud of the motivation and knowledge I was able to provide my team and the CEO of the company even thanked me personally on my hard work which meant a lot. My approach  in managing customer health is providing a listening ear and actually take heed to what the customers issue is so I can provide the best solution possible. I remain calm and wait patiently as the customer describes what problem they are having, once they are done I apologize for the inconvenience while also offering a solution to the problem. This lets the customer know that I understand where they coming from and I have their best interest at heart which creates a healthy customer relationship. The most important thing I am looking for is a challenge and an opportunity to grown within the business. No yes no',\n",

Yes ok  A little but not too much I have lead several teams that included several different areas of expertise.  I developed a call center, implemented to CRM’s and warehousing. I believe it is important to know who your customers are, what makes THEM successful and helping them reach their fullest potential.  In my call center experience I used KPI’s and benchmarking along with quality assurance measures to monitor customer satisfaction. I want (need) a challenge.  I thrive on it.  I am a born adaptive thinker - I do not look at things as a problem but rather an opportunity to do something better.  I enjoy working with innovative thinkers and those who want to make a difference.I am hoping my next opportunity provide a positive and collaborative culture.

I have managed contact centers, but partnered with marketing teams at Dyson and SmartThings to build strategy around sales and promotions. Yes, I partnered with marketing.  No, I have not specifically worked in the marketing department Yes  My social team (specifically) worked with Salesforce.  But what I liked most about it was reviewing the sales and returns.  I like to understand the amount of revenue we produce - in the context of returns. SmartThings: They did not have consistent or accurate reporting.  I rebuilt the Zendesk metrics, reformatted dashboards, constructed a scorecard, and measured agent, team, and site performance.  Prior to me joining the team, they did not have this reporting, and what reporting they had was inaccurate.  And at Dyson, I improved their sales >800% from Oct. 2014 thru Mar. 2017 This is a difficult question to respond to.  I would need more context, and I would like understand what has been measured in the past, what is being measured today (what is important to the business), and what is the future state we are attempting to achieve.  In the past, I have created measurements, and improved all other measurements.  For instance, I have been very successful in increasing sales, NPS, CSAT, conversion rates, and quality measurements.  I have also been successful in decreasing email response times, handle times, and business costs (which are defined differently by each company).  At Dyson, I had a 3.1M positive P&L in my final year, and increased sales by over 800% in 2.5 years.  I will make a huge impact on you business, but I would need to have greater dialogue around this question. An opportunity to make an impact for your business.  I know that building a great customer experience and improving sales is important - and I have a consistent history of doing that. No Yes www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-skowron-97418b5 Thank you',\n",

I like the organization of SalesForce, especially for a particular client's information, revenue, address, contacts, etc. I mentor Account Executives that are just hired from the Account Management role.  We don't particularly have milestones, but all the Mentees I've taught are still with the company and are very successful in their role.  I'm most proud of the leaps and bounds they've made in learning the role and developing relationships with their clients. I believe trust is the most impactful attribute to retaining a client.  Building a relationship, delivering on promises and providing a prompt, yet detailed response to any of their questions goes a long way.  Overall, I think just making sure we are doing a great job for them is what makes a client comfortable in working with me.  Key metrics, Growth and client strategy all follow in line when trust and confidence are achieved. I want role with the opportunity for growth within the company.  Per my resume, I learn my role quickly and have moved up in each company I've worked for. no yes no Thank you!  Have a great day!\",\n",

Helping a customer be successful using our technology is one of the best ways to retain business. Key metrics are crucial to measuring the success of our strategies. Culture is important to me.

       "  'applicant_replies': ' Yes I have dealing with customer success for the past 17yrs. When I was at Verizon I not only managed the customer sale but the follow up and success the customer had during the life of the customer. I had one of the lowest churn rates so that speaks volumes to my success planning and follow up. Yes  How it keeps everything in one spot and reminds you where you left off. In less than 10 months I managed a team from both Verizon and Sprints B2B teams to build their business from .5 million in monthly reoccurring revenue to 1.8 million. The company thought it would take 2 yrs to hit that goal.  This was done through face 2 face meeting and trainings as well as webinars. Grew the market from 2 major markets in the central time zone to 6 in a short time period. Best strategy because everyone is different is to ASK what the customer would like to see and work around those options. These have to be realistic but often the best way to reach them is ask them. You then work towards that request and make sure you stick to it. Being organized is key to customers success and reduced churn.  But it is different with every customer and company. I have done a lot on my own and I really enjoy helping a team be successful and grow. I enjoy the sales and teaching as much as I liked solution selling and retention. I am at the part of my life where I want to help others reach what I have achieved in my career. No Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/todd-busch-66a2289 Thanks',\n",

We built the group up from nothing and developed our own methodology for applying tools like journey mapping, service design and design thinking to helping customers re-imagine their digital customer experiences. I trained our most recent group of CSMs at Lithium and we focused on a few key metrics - NPS for sure, but also looked at product feature uptake and social business maturity. To measure that, I created a diagnostic tool for our CSMs to guide their customer discussions and help assess each customer's maturity level. This then guides planning around future services and product / feature implementation. We also tracked things like contact frequency, executive relationships strength, professional services engagements, etc. Culture is very important to me.

Additionally, the centralized aspect of the tool for go-to information that an entire organization can relay on for consistency. I currently lead a technical and project management team. When I began at the firm, and started to focus on this consulting team, I realized there were few processes, no standard deliverables and much less business development tools; so I began to analyze the teams existing assets, areas that could be immediately capitalized on and those needing improvements. Milestones that we hit together include: robust standardized communication, deliverables, timelines and also business development tools such as presentations to bring in more revenue. This enhanced our client's experience and enabled account mgmt to run much smoother. Retention is definitely key, I agree! For customer health its a matter of putting a plan/roadmap in place that can be tailored per client per project milestone.

       "  'applicant_replies': ' Hi, I have been working in customer success for about 5 years. I have had the opportunity to build and grow customer success and support teams. Additionally, I worked as one of the first Community Operations Managers at Uber to spearhead the UberEats Account Management team. Yes   I like Salesforce because I can customize it to fit any of my business needs. The last team I lead was running Customer Success and QA at Printavo. I had the great opportunity of hiring the our first Account Manager, helped grow ARR to 1M+ USD and created and produced the company\\'s first annual conference:  Print Husters Conf. My approach to managing customer health is to be proactive. Meaning, digging deep into analytics and learning client stories to have a more personal and consultative relationship. Key metrics include, but are not limited to:  customer acquisition/retention cost, MRR, churn rates and customer lifetime value. Understanding the full customer profile(s) allows me to create made-to-measure processes and strategies that will drive the company\\'s overall success. The most important thing I am looking for in a new role is an opportunity for continued to growth and development personally and professionally. I look forward to building very successful and dynamic teams that really defines what it means to be what I like to call a \"Customer Hero\". No. Yes. Yes:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanparker14/ Thank you so much! I really appreciate your time and considering me for this great opportunity.',\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Ok! My entire career has been in customer service, in one way or another. I spent about 6 years working in Hospitality with a majority of that time spent with Marriott. I grew a very solid foundation of customer service skills working for this company and have continued to utilize that training throughout my career. After working in the hospitality industry, I completely pivoted to a tech startup where I was an Account Consultant, helping service customers and their web based businesses. After spending a couple of years there, I did leave the company because there were no growth opportunities at the time. I ended up getting a teaching position in China and uprooted myself for a year of teaching and travel throughout Asia. When I came back, I jumped right into the tech start up scene again with a position at Belly Card where I was a part of the 7-11 team. I had my hand in a lot of different projects and support aspects there before I was laid off. Following that I was at another start up in the commercial cleaning industry as an Account Manager as well as Operations Manager. And now to my current role at Snapsheet where I have been for almost 2 years. I'm currently a Customer Success Manager for our Inbound call team, as well as manage 4 of our other managers. No. I do not have direct experience with marketing technology. No I started my career in the Hotel industry. When I moved into tech it was with SingleHop, which sells servers. At Belly Card we sold a tech platform for digital loyalty. At OfficeLuv we had a tech solution for office supply replenishment and cleaning services. At SnapSheet we have a tech platform to expedite the claims process for auto accidents.  The ease of being able to house all of a clients information in one spot, including email communications, appointment dates, and services they are subscribed to. It's a great one-stop-shop for their data. I am very proud of the team I'm currently coaching. It's a team of 15 individuals who service our incoming call volume to the company. It can be a high stress position due to the volume of calls we service, and not knowing the nature of what that inbound call is going to entail. I had the opportunity of launching our very first inbound team last summer, and am incredibly proud to be able to look back and see where we are today because going in we didn't know what to expect. It took a lot of trial and error to understand how we needed to service our customers, how many agents we needed staffed, and what specific phone Q's we needed to add. Those that helped in it's launch knew going in that it was going to be kind of crazy, but we knew that together we'd get through it. And we did. Today we have built out better processes surrounding what our Inbound team looks like and the service that we give to our customers. We have the highest QA scores amongst the rest of the organization, and that is something that I take great pride in. That I am able to give them the support that they need to be successful, and that I can coach to our quality standards. I liken customer retention to employee retention. Even your top performers need to have the same touch points as your low performers, because once you get comfortable and think they're solid with where there at, that's when the problems start. It's important to make sure that metrics are in place for each account, growth milestones, and to have proper communication cadence in place to stay ahead of the ball. I think it's important for a customer to feel like you are their go-to person, and that they can trust you. At the end of the day, we are all humans, and making that human connection with a client is going to do wonders for the overall health of the account. The most important thing is having tools in place to be able to do my job well. One of the most challenging things that I currently go through is not having those tools, and trying to make the best out of what I do. For example, there are a lot of inconsistencies with data which makes it difficult for us to be able to forecast accurately for business needs. Oftentimes when going through employee reviews, the tools we have to support their performance is lacking. Additionally, clear growth and variety in work is very important to me. I want to be with a company for a long time and be able to progress - not just into different roles, but have exposure to more challenging work. No Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/cara-mooney-77b62b27/ Thank you!\",\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I have been in Customer Success for about 7 years now no I've works in a few different industries across a few different models, from a true SaaS offering in Learning and Development, Logistics as a Service in the food delivery space, and a hybrid of hardware and SaaS solutions within the Trucking industry.  All of my experiences have lended themselves to a robust understanding of what creates a client for life.  the endless possibilities.  With integrations and an inward flow of data, Salesforce can be used to monitor the health of a given client or segment at any given time.  The user friendliness of the reports and dashboards give internal users great insight to where the clientbase stands at any given moment i currently lead 2 cross-functional teams (5 client success managers, and 5 Field Service reps) that have worked together to hit our retention and sales metrics.  I'm proud of the fact that we've built this from the ground up.  This Client Success function didn't exist prior to my arrival and retention was low.  We've been able to come in and turn around the customer sentiment, keep people on the platform, and we grew the existing client base by over 10% last year. In order to retain clients, it's important to make sure that they are using and getting value out of the system.  I look at things like how many people are using the product at a given client, who sees the data, how often, how many different departments are seeing value - how deep are our roots.  It's important to track how they are using the system, are they using it at a very basic level, do they have all the bells and whistles, are they using the system in the way it was designed, are they engaging in feedback loops to constantly improve the product.  I also like to take into consideration things like contract growth, NPS, and satisfaction scores as well as client side parameters like POC turnover, executive turnover, and overall company health.  When any of these things change, there is a playbook for what happens to make sure that everything gets back in balance. I'm looking for a great, stable company that client-centric and understands that Customer Success isn't just a role, but a company mindset.  In the opportunity, I want to be able to grow a team and a client base, to build the systems and processes that help us better support our clients and lead to increased revenue for the company. no yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-meyers-06b5782a/ Awesome, thanks so much!\",\n",

When I joined the firm, we had a low customer retention. The key is to make sure that the employees are engaged and satisfied. They are the \"window\" to our customers. Then, we built internal processes and customer-centric methodologies to increase customer retention. After one year, we increased customer ratings to 99% satisfaction.. the key is first employee satisfaction, and then create metrics to measure client engagement and satisfaction levels.

The powerful dashboards, advanced analytics, and integrations with marketing tools. My team of 15 reduced churn from 2.4% to 1.2% over 12 months.  We also increased our clients health (usage) scores by 25%.  I am most proud of the fact the we built the team from 5 to 15 during that time with zero turnover. I believe that the most important KPI is usage - if a client is not using the product then there is little chance of retention.  To ensure usage (of key features) the account management team must constantly engage with the client.  Accordingly, understanding the clients needs and then ensuring frequent touches (contact) is of paramount importance. Working within a team of smart and passionate people.  Even with a great product, without the right people there is little chance of success. no yes https://www.linkedin.com/pub/keith-plummer/a/561/843 Okay.  Thanks.',\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': ' I have been working in customer success for over 20 years. I started working in customer service in 1998 with Shoe Carnival, where I established a reputation for being able to build strong rapport with the customers. I started out as a sales associate, then was promoted to the position of floor supervisor. In 2000 I took a position with Wireless retail as an implementation manager, and in that role I worked with employees in five state region teaching best customer service practices and working to staff out locations with the best candidates available. In 2010 I embarked on a career path in higher education as an admissions advisor, the role of admissions advisor requires one to have excellent customer service and relationship building skills while being able to gain an understanding of client needs and being able to articulate a path to help them reach career and life goals. I followed that path to Career Education Corporation, and then on the Adler University where I has able to add to my skill set and learn how to best meet customer need. The career experience in addition to my educational background in business management have allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the customer success field, while learning how to be effective in leadership and helping to train and inspire others to work as a team to reach organizational goals. Yes  I like that Salesforce is a custom designed CRM that is implemented with the specific needs of the organization that is using it. Salesforce is easily navigable and helps to manage a large data base of leads. The last team I lead was with Career Education Corporation where I functioned as a department lead, my specific team consisted of eight advisors and I was tasked with developing best practices that lead to the better handling of leads, timely follow up, and superior customer service. We were able to routinely hit our monthly enrollment targets and stand out among other teams that we were compared to. I am most proud of the camaraderie that we developed as a team, and the way we were able to utilize the talents of each team member to meet our goals. My approach to managing customer health is the building of relationships with the customers we interact with, many times the area of opportunity that is missed is building the necessary rapport with the client base. It is imperative that the customer can feel that the person(s) that they are interacting with has a genuine care for them and the service that they are being provided. Metrics are key, measuring factors like customers contacted in a work day, timely follow up, and product knowledge all lead to good customer health. Ultimately thins factors can be positively effected by leaders paying attention to detail, and taking time to cultivate and develop their team. The most important thing to me in my next opportunity is aligning with a strong company, with a positive culture, and  being able to establish a fruitful career with long-term growth opportunity.

I believe that my experience directly related to customer success via the relationships built and managed with staff, customers and vendors. Not really The closest work re Tech other than Cardiac PET, was at Uniloc/Sureloc and the other start up prior.  The Uniloc project specifically was involved in a digital rights technology that dealt with the locking and safe distribution of digital content regretfully, I have little to now experience with them, but I have spent some time on Salesforce and wouldnt anticipate an issue.  Like stated above I have little experience but dont feel it would be an issue..  if I had to provide an answer, it would be the ability to track customers effeciently Interesting question.  Full disclosure, I was managing Positron as the only Director and Officer for the last 3 or so years.  I successfully led the team through an involuntary bankruptcy which encompassed keeping staff calm but yet efficient, while doing the same with customers vendors and investors. My history is somewhat general.  I do and treat my customer etc. with the upmost integrity/character  within the existing culture at the firm.  I also feel that one's ability to listen and learn while building a relationship is key Difficult to say in all honesty.  I have spent the last 20 years in an entrepreneurial situation.

Much of that time has included management experience among with customer service and customer relations responsibilities, e.g. on-boarding, relationship management, account reviews, presentations, and day-to-day problem solving. Yes  That I like best about Salesforce is the ease of use, scalability, plethora of reporting options, and the lead/account/opportunity functionality with tracking activity, adding and saving contacts, email campaign options, and note taking abilities with each activity logged. Currently as Vice President of Business Consulting for Bank of America Merchant Services, I currently lead a team of Business Analysts, Account Managers, Product Specialists, and Inside Sales reps. In 2017, my team finished first amongst the 13 VPs in the Specialized Industry division, and we were #8 overall in the entire company out of about a dozen of teams. My approach is monitoring key metrics such as overall product usage, depth of usage, breadth of usage, account growth, customer account lifespan, renewals achieved, upsell numbers, survey results/ customer feedback, customer's executives' relationship with my company, and customer support performance. These KPIs and metrics help determine the direction of everything from customer support to sales, product development, and overall company direction; they provide insight and influence all aspects of a business. Achieving these goals is possible through continuous training, building relationships with customers through positivity in every interaction, complete understanding of the product and industry trends to become a trusted advisor and expert in the eyes of the customer, proper usage of internal systems, effective cross-department collaboration, and constantly refining our processes. The most important thing I am looking for is the ability to grow with a company and help a company grow. It is symbiotic; by providing my management experience and professional expertise as a member of the team, I believe it will benefit both the company and my career. No Yes.

In terms of leading teams, I'm very proud to have seen more than 75% of my direct reports promoted to bigger and better roles after spending time on my team. The key is always communication.  Clear metrics and shared success criteria are a must have, and then frequent, honest and open communication about action plans, gaps to goal and end user experience feedback is critical.  I find too often software companies forget about the end user.  The most successful interactions I've had involve the software companies spending time with the user and not just allowing feedback, but actively soliciting feedback on the product.

       "  'applicant_replies': ' To me, building relationships is what makes the world go around, and what I mean about that is I care about my clients so much that their success is my success.  Not only do I want to see them succeed professionally, but building that relationship with them and getting to know them on a personal level, I almost feel like I\\'m helping a friend or family member out, that is how much I care about the success of my clients and why the Client Success Manager position fits my personality and strong suits to a tee. The way I look at time management, is that time is money and prioritizing/organizing my day allows me to service all of my clients exactly how they deserve, which is great customer service!  I have always taken numerous time management courses over the years as I\\'m a big believer in maximizing every single work day.  What I mean by that is that there is so much to be done and having a solid time management plan in place allows me to be efficient with my time while always being there for my customers. NO I stared off with 6 years of sales in all different industries which was an awesome experience that I learned so much from. It really taught me about how to build relationships and fill my clients needs.  After my sales experiences, I wanted to see a different side of the business, so over the last 2.5 years I now work on the business operations side of things in the Customer Management department for the largest beer producer, importer and distributor in all of North American (constellation brands).  I\\'m in charge of the whole east coast and making sure the right beer is in the right place at the right time.  On top of that, I work with 100+ wholesalers to make sure they\\'re being serviced appropriately so my current role is very similar to \"client success\" that made me so intrigued with this opportunity with you, Abby.  The software I use currently is all of Microsoft Office (took 3 Microsoft excel courses in the last 6 months), plus JD Edwards which is massive software platform that allows me to stay on top of inventory levels, distributor out of stocks, in transit reports, etc I am open to travel, but with a 1 year old baby at home would love to be in Chicago as much as I can to be with my young family, but yes i\\'m open to travel 15-20% of the time, but probably nothing more than that yesz yes  yes yes yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianlewen/ sounds great',\n",

I was a Team Leader for Uber for 3 years. Yes. By training the employees yes the customers were being helped by to make sure every customer left happy, all questions answered and feeling like they were ready to be successful. Also, leaving the person with a feeling that if they ever needed any help again, that it would always be there for them.  Using the Uber Partner app, as well as the Uber rider app, I have done well over 20 demos to show any new changes that existing clients may see and should be aware of, as well as doing product demos for onboarding new partners.

The way people perceive a company or its brand impacts return business and word-of-mouth promotion. It is also rewarding to see successful programs takeoff and watch how they can make a positive impact on sales. It is important to create a schedule and make room for important and urgent tasks. At the end of each day, I will review my schedule and make changes in preparation for the next day. I will also create blocks for calls and emails to encourage productivity. Yes We worked on building ongoing communication with our clients. It would start with the onboarding process and continue with weekly and monthly follow-ups.  During our follow-ups, we would focus on communicating ROI, ideas, improvement strategies, continued needs analysis, implementing solutions, and preparing custom performance reports for our main contacts to share with their teams. If the client feels that they are valued, they will be less inclined to leave and more inclined to use your services for additional projects/programs.

From onboarding clients and teaching them about our product, to providing suggestions throughout the partnership, I feel personally connected and responsible for their success. I'm a bit of an organization freak. I make sure all my emails are in their proper folders, presentations, files, etc. I also like to carve out a half hour in the morning to go through my emails and priorittze my tasks for the day Yes We set target KPI metrics at the beginning of the year and worked closely on certain tasks to ensure satisfaction by providing 5 star customer service  While being comfortable with the product and having heathy relationships are important, at the end of the day, clients want to feel that they are spending their money wisely. ROI is what they want and as a SaaS you have to be able to demonstrate value to the customer in a way that will keep them in a partnership I've used BlueJeans for sharing my screen with clients for remote product demonstrations or just monthly catchups.

Finally, I utilize gaps in between their responses to get other non-pressing work done. Yes. Although not a traditional software firm.

That included our AMs visiting the client leadership to interview them about their experiences and also sharing usage stats with the leadership about their organization user's engagement with our product. In addition, SDMs and CSMs were given the leeway to cultivate relationships with super-users to make sure their concerns were being looked after.  Primarily Webex and Go-To-Meeting.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I like helping people get what they need and what they didn't even realize they were missing. I like to break things down into smaller tasks. It can make a big project seem less overwhelming and it's a good way to find a starting point if you're not really sure where to begin. When you break a big hours-long project into smaller pieces that take, in some cases, just a few minutes each, it's easier to get everything completed properly. Not with a software company specifically, but I have helped onboard clients with new software before. No I was a client service representative for the Chicago Tribune. A big part of my job there was ensuring notices placed to the classified department were placed properly and completed on time so they could appear in the paper. We switched to a self- service provider while I was there that gave our clients a bit more autonomy, a big part of my job was assisting them  to learn about the new features. I left so that I could pursue more creative opportunities, and currently I'm a freelance copywriter and social media manager and I spend a lot of time doing research on different topics for my clients.  I've done a lot of product demos and step-by-step walk-throughs primarily with adit, which is the Tribune's in house software. I also used adobe, hootsuite, surveymonkey, mailchimp, Microsoft office of course, salesforce. There were a few others that were similar to those, but those are probably the best known.

We would also conduct on-going product trainings for end users and provide product usage reports showing areas of opportunity.

       "  'applicant_replies': ' My father started his own business when I was 3 years old and I\\'ve seen him grown his business into a successful, passionate business. I\\'ve also seen the struggles he went through with making business decisions. Working in a role that has a direct and positive influence on a business is something that I am truly passionate about! My secret is perspective. It is very easy to become overwhelmed with client requests and projects, but being able to see how each aspect fits into the larger picture, and then prioritize accordingly, is key. If you take a step back you may realize that an issue/task may not seem as urgent as it first seemed. No I have not worked for a software directly, but I have used software in nearly all aspects of my jobs. Salesforce.com, SQL, Microsoft Office, and Google Suite are all vital tools I use everyday. Without these amazing tools, my day-to-day would be significantly more time consuming and stressful. Software is essential to scale/streamline nearly every business.  I believe the biggest reason customers leave is due to poorly set expectations. Whether expectations are set during the sales or onboarding process, that is where you should really take the time to set yourself and the customer up for success. The motto I take to heart for my current role is \"Under-promise and over-deliver\". I\\'ve used a wide range of softwares to present and train customers on a product. They include Salesforce.com, Microsoft Powerpoint, Google Slides, and Uber\\'s own proprietary software. My most recent experience was when I was an Onboarding Specialist for Uber Eats. I visited restaurants in-person, walked them through our software/app and how to accept orders, as well as presenting them with ket tips to set their restaurant up for success. In addition to that, I would have answers/examples planned out ahead of time for any potential questions they may have. Absolutely! I view travel as an exciting aspect for any role and also an opportunity to grow professionally. Yes  No Yes Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelhfischer/',\n",

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I like being a main point of contact for clients to come to with any questions, ideas, or concerns. Working one on one with people making sure they have the most positive and impactful experience possible is something that motivates me. Making sure I'm staying as organized as possible is key. Prioritizing projects to make sure everything is taken care of in a timely manner is super important. No I have worked as a Digital Marketing Consultant for a year. Working with small to medium sized businesses in regards to their online / digital marketing. After relocating to Chicago in June, I worked 100% remote. Prospecting, cold calling, then setting up in person or virtual meetings with decision makers. After closing the deal it would then be my responsibility to ensure a smooth on-boarding process for the client, then pass the account on to the account manager to oversee.  At Townsquare, we presented using PowerPoint. One of the most exciting parts about the job was finally getting to sit down with someone one on one. I find the prospect gets a much better understanding of the product. In doing so, they are able to gain trust in you and the company as well. I would present anywhere from 2-4 meetings a day. We also relied on Salesforce to maintain and manage leads effectively. Yes. In my last role, I was in and out of the office on a daily basis. Also, our corporate office was located in Charlotte, NC. yes  No yes yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooke-felderman-76217180/\",\n",

Whether that’s utliliizng a personal calendar and scoping out my week, or ensuring that I’m allocating tasks across my team to ensure they are completed. Yes Definitely increased client interaction and that personal touch.  We spent time visiting clients, getting to know their business, so that we could present options and ideas before they even may have asked.  As well, ensuring that any client issues/concerns were quickly addressed and did not occur more than once.  Well in terms of just presenting the demos themselves, I have used Citrix, RingCentral, most of the name brand apps, but I’m not sure if that is the question.

I am very well organized. Time management is a huge part of that. I take a thoughtful approach to my week, starting by thinking about each day at the beginning of it and reviewing my calendar to see how my day looks and what to expect and where unexpected items might fall so not to fall short on time and to leave enough time for the work that falls along with each client interaction. Yes There were several ways - 1) User groups to understand the needs v. actuals; 2) Touch point improvement with the client; 3) Response time to client inquiries; 3) Improving the software based on client feedback, even if over several years (quarter by quarter) - offering communication about the upcoming changes on a quarterly basis so not to over commit, but to attempt to over deliver and; 5) Always improving customer service through providing items like better data driven analytics, ROI, U/I, use cases, etc.  I have had several years of experience presenting product demos both live and on line. I have used several web-based applications to do so - mostly conference services that have web integration like GoTo Meeting, Zoom Video, WebEx, Join, We just started using UberConference. Yes.

For example I value strategizing with them on how to use the product more effectively and share what the trends are in the industry to keep them on top of their game and what are the other best practices are in the industry. I make room for important and urgent tasks first. Secondly, I devise a schedule. Remove myself social media and time suckers, learn how to say \"No\", allow others to help me and finally try not to multi-task if I\\'m going to waste time doing so. Yes As most customer leave because they feel you do not care about them, a great way to increase customer retention is to build the relationship. It\\'s not possible to make strategies to increase retention on paper, so having a wide range of data and information about your customers helps measure and analyze their behavior.  So, my company kept VIP customers, targeted customers with special offers, rewarded are most profitable customers, personalized follow ups and scheduled time with our customers.  Yes, when demonstrated the effectiveness of our Waste Management Solution over our competitors, I always demonstrate Macro over Micro,   value, not features or functionalities and speak their language.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" Hello. I've always enjoyed showing clients new solutions and methods of understanding our products / services. It's great to see a project turn out to be a successful product for the client to understand and love. Depending on the project and tasks, I like to use collaborative tools such as Asana and Jira to balance work within the team. For myself, I keep a list of my tasks and must do responsibilities throughout the day. I've worked in software and as a project manager. While working at Buy Back Pros, I've been the lead project manager and work with  team of awesome developers, designers, and other project leads located all over the globe. Yes We implemented new features on our website which is where most of our clients process orders. We use heat maps to do analytics on where the clients are spending time and clicking. We also recently added a new support solution that allows us to instantly live chat with customers, have chat bots when staff are unavailable, and organize emails / tickets much more efficiently.  I tend do use more than just screenshots. Simple tools such as Screencastify allow a user to create video screencasts of their interface. It can record a tab, window, or the full screen. Audio can also be used as well. I've seen that this has made our communication much more clear. Yes  Yeah. I'd like to earn close to $65,000 living in Chicago. Yes Sure Yes https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-b-herwitz/ Thank you I appreciate your time and this chatbot. Very cool.\",\n",

Yes I think getting out to meet the customer face-to-face is very important. I spend 20-30% of every month in New York meeting with my clients. Also, I think building relationships with them outside of work is important as well. I have focused on taking my clients to lunch or dinner to get to know them on a personal level.  Of course. I do in-person demos with C-level clients and daily users. When not in New York (where most of my clients are based), I do a lot demos via WebEx. I try to ask a lot questions initially to try to get a better understanding of how the customer plans to use the product and then tailor the demo to those needs. Yes, I travel 20% of the time now.

Additionally, I enjoy cultivating relationships with my clients. I lean heavily on to-do lists broken down by client and prioritized. Then, I block time on my calendar each day to work on these projects amongst the other meetings that are going on. Yes By having a healthy paranoia with each account. If you assume each client is completely satisfied, you open the door to unpleasant surprises. Instead my teams have always managed our accounts trying to uncover anything that might be upsetting the client.  When I worked at HighGround, I was constantly tasked at presenting product demos that were tailored to the specific clients needs. Sometimes this would mean presenting a quick high level overview, and other times diving into the fine details. Above all, it was important to understand the audience and what they were looking to get out of the conversation.

       "  'applicant_replies': \" I love working with the clients and solving their problems. The unique problems that they bring to me are like puzzles, and I love to push my mind to greater height and working with clients allows me to do that. Open communication with my bosses, so that they know what I'm working on as well as I'll know that I'm focusing on the most important things. I also utilize my outlook calendar, trello, jira, and other online project management tools to make sure that I'm organized and optimizing my time. Yes I spearheaded this project, we looked at the account analytics and figured out that account who purchased an annual subscription retained at a higher rate, so I reached out to monthly accounts that had a high enough engagement score and attempted to convert them to an annual subscription. I also provide very personal customer service that makes the accounts feel the love!  Customers leave because they don't feel they need the service. I feel like that falls under all of those categories. When it comes down to it, if you haven't built a relationship and onboard/trained the customer well enough to where the software isn't sticky, if they are not getting the results they want, they'll leave. I have presented product demos for Wonderlic's proprietary software, as well as presenting and training people to use our online marketing platform. I have used Google Analytics, Google AdWords, Adobe Creative Cloud, Final Cut Pro, Avid, Wordpress, Netsuite, Olark, JIRA, Trello, WordPress, Google Suite, and Microsoft Office.

And I find that for any company to be successful, it depends on how you treat the client with respect, and know how to retain them. I go about my day setting daily goals about what's important 1st, and what needs to be pushed back. But things do change, so I just make sure it's added to calendar to be taken care of right away or towards the end of the day. But I have to thank my project management skills. It's helped me to this very day. Yes By always updating them on new software coming out, and trying to see if we can get discount before it's priced.  Sales Force is the last software I used. I find it to be really user friendly because I can shear my screen with the client, or I just travel to clients location. Yes I am. Will this be base or just salary?

      "[['  I agree with you I would like to have more direct conversation with poeple'], [\" In terms of complexity, I would have to say the Reimbursement Site I've recently completed as a training project. It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table. As I've said, my most recent project was the reimbursement site. I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked. I've learned about how to use servlets and AJAX calls to get databases and websites working together, and how to connect to databases from Java. I've also learned that JavaScript can be too lenient for the programmer's own good.  I like that python is relatively simple, but also highly versatile. I also like the dictionary collection type, as i find that the key-value pairings make organizing and retrieving data much simpler (I've got to explore this advantage in detail in an Information Retrieval course I took in Spring). Mostly I'm just happy to have an opportunity to learn more about software development and gain more experience that will help me in the industry. I admit that I am unfamiliar with .Net programs, which I've seen come up on a few job postings, so I feel that it's something I could use. I also would like to learn more about Angular, which I've only touched upon. I feel that it helps when I have some sort of deadline to meet. Say I have a project that requires me to use knowledge I don't have, so I'll try to find examples of that knowledge in action, in pieces if I must, and work from that to get my program working. I admit to being relatively new to full stack, so Maven, AWS, TomCat and Git are all that I'm really familiar with.

I have worked on Python software used in a production phone system. I worked on a project to create a Python program to edit xml tags based on read in csv files to create contact cards for our phone side cars. Working with the lead developer of our phone system he gave me the parameters and test files along with sample output. Working off of this I created the program and tested with different input. I learned how to better work with csv files in Python as I had not done that much before. Definitely useful for future projects going forward.  Python is a great language to use because of its versatility. A chance to grow and learn. SQL and git are the things I would probably most like to learn but any chance to deepen my knowledge is something I will be excited for. There is almost no subject I am not excited and motivated to learn about. The best learning method I have found is asking questions and looking at others' examples. This usually takes the least time and provides a chance to gain understanding from others' experience. I do have some experience with AWS but I am not well versed in full stack development.

On the project we were asked to set up different objects for both those chatting and the rooms that they would be entering\\n\\nFrom the beginning, you were only primarily concerned with the people in the chat, them being unique to an array of different javascript users and being contained in their own chat room. Once the functionality was figured out there via different mocha tests, an HTML page was set up to keep track of user logs and to keep it contained within the individual chats. For added fun, we added a feature that would send our location, in much the same way that a real client keeps track of your location The best part of the process was that it was centered around the front end of a Node.js project. Most of the new skills I learned were centered around that framework, with a bit of exposure to jQuery and how to use the fields on the page to extract data to different objects.\\n\\nIn a lot of ways, Javascript and the accompanying technologies are very open-ended to use, but it all seems very portable to since it can function for both personal and enterprise projects  The most ideal thing that I look for with a new opportunity is having the right people in place to help foster my growth as a programmer and more importantly as a problem solver. Too often we get caught up in the great things happening today in technology that we forget that there are small steps to get there that require both discipline and a good frame of mind. So I'd love to just jump in to maintaining projects and learning the right practices from people already there New languages that I would love to learn would be more .NET simply because of the wide number of enterprise places using it, and python since a lot of the math centered functions there would help supplement the mathematics I learned in college\\n\\nAs for tech, Electron, React, and Spring Boot are some of the more bustling things that I would love to take a look at for personal projects At times it is important to take a step back and learn the beginning things from time to time. If you can learn the beginnings of a language or if you can see small demonstrations in action, usually more often than not, the rest comes just as easy, if not faster and you gain additional enjoyment having something concrete to play with With something such as AWS or Maven, the right tool for the job comes down to how you feel you want your data presented. Is it something that can be done in an SQL solution, is the data more dynamic and requiring noSQL solutions such as mongoDB, along with a variety of other data solutions that AWS may include\\n\\nAs for building stuff with maven, those usually come with the basic requirements of a java project.

I believe I can answer this questions of yours based on the projects that I've worked on. To talk about the most complex project, I should tell you about the one that I worked on when I started off my graduate studies. I developed an algorithm to find the shortest path between any 2 stations in New York subway. I had to gather all the maps pertaining to the subway system. And I found out all the junction points where we can make transfers to different lines. I had to make sure that I didn't miss even a single junction point, as that would lead to miscalculations. I applied Dijkstra's algorithm for that project. And I developed the project using Java. But, I tried out other languages to improve my knowledge. Sure.  I like the versatility of the language. One can literally do wonders with Python. It covers various domains that I can work on. And there are so many libraries that make my work easier. I've always searched for new things to learn and challenges to face. The projects that I work on are chosen keeping that in mind. That being said, I'm looking for new opportunities to showcase my skills, solve complex problems and grow along with the organization. There are 2 things that I'd like to try my hands on. One being the different frameworks of Javascript, as there's a plethora out there. And the other being mobile app development: iOS and Android. I've chosen this field as my career because I find it interesting and challenging. I know for a fact that I have to dedicate my life to it if I have to be successful. That being said, I believe one shouldn't search for time or motivation to acquire new knowledge, as it is implicit that one should focus on this at all times. To be frank, I've used Azure more than AWS. However, picking the right tools depends only on 2 factors, according to me. They are: 1.The problem we are dealing with, and, 2. Customer preference I hold an employment authorization and I'm authorized to work for any employer in the US without any restriction. But probably in a few years of time, I'd need sponsorship.

I had to retrieve datas from UI such as android apps with the use of JSON. And manipulate those data into the banks system. So the most resent project I had to work for was another banking system which uses a kind of online payment method which is similar to what PayPal does. Had to incorporate that into online transaction through the bank itself. Retrieving information on the account used to make the purchase and handling data security was something I was in charge of. I learned how to make the system more secured and to decrease the runtime of the program itself so that the process was smooth and had a good flow. I learnt more about restful server while working on this project. I also learnt about the flow towards the backend of the system. I found that the entire task should not fall back on the UI side but also the backend of the system to make the software you have designed more stable and secure.  I like that the code is not as complex to use and in a Linux system it does wonders. I’m all about using c programming on a Linux system but python helped me cut down so much of the coding process because of its features. I’m all about team work and communication when I’m working on a project. I feel like it’s one of the main aspect to help build a company. I also look forward towards proper planning and management while working on a project. In addition to that as technology keeps on updating itself so I feel like it’s important for a company to crate a good learning environment as well. These days I have been wanting to work more on .net. I have heard so much about it and would love to see how it would work with the ideas I have I understand it’s time consuming which is why I tend to do those things on my off time and not on the company’s time. I in person love research work and accruing new knowledge in my free time. It’s kind of an early hobby I acquired as a child. It’s my hobby to look into things and find something interesting to read. I guess my motivation is my willingness to learn more. For me I have mostly worked on Maven then on cloud. I feel like picking out the right tool for the job would depend on what type of features the client want and analyzing what would go well with what the client wants.

In terms of complexity, I would rate it a 6/10 (10 being extremely complex and 1 being trivial). The project previously stated was the most recent project I have worked on, and it was an application aimed at competitive users of the popular online card game Hearthstone. I worked with a group of 5 peers. First, I made the project specifications and design. Then, I broke my team up into smaller groups to focus on front and back end. I ended up joining the back end team. I was responsible for setting up certain tables for our database to hold both user and deck information. I then wrote the code for the API that interacted with our server in order to process commands on the user side. I forgot to mention the testing aspect of the process, in which I wrote code in order to test as many lines of written code as possible. I had to learn Javascript (enough to get the application done) to make this application possible. Another aspect I learned about making software is the planning that needs to be done beforehand, such as specification and design documents. I also learned how to communicate and work with others to meet deadlines.

I currently work in a supervisor position at Northeastern, but we have prepared someone to fill my role here so I can move forward with my career in software development, which I'm very excited to do. I love logic and math, which made computer science my natural calling. The most recent project I did was a web app that would allow someone to generate an over the top Hip Hop album cover. I started with a basic wireframe, then created mockups for each page with Adobe Illustrator. Then, I moved on to actually coding it. The end result consisted of a an image, with a few backgrounds to cycle through, and a bunch of small icons that could be endlessly dragged and dropped on to the image, as well as two fields to enter an artist name and album title, which would be displayed over the image and dragged objects. I had a lot of fun making it. When I started the project, I had no idea how deep the capabilities of draggables and droppables was. I had to learn a lot about those to get that functionality working.  I love how readable it is, the syntax is so common sense, and it always looks clean and organized. Learning opportunities.

It keeps everything organized neatly for larger projects. No Yes No\"], [\" The biggest project software project I've worked on is a game project currently under development by myself and 3 other associates. I am one of 2 primary programmers on the job, the other programmer being in charge of determining what we need, and myself primarily filling in those needs. The last project I was present for from beginning to end is a front-end design for a UX course. I, along with 2 others, were responsible from coming up with an application idea and implementing the agile process to get a prototype finished and polished. Being more hands-on that conceptual myself, I took responsibility for translating our needs into designs, and our designs into a program. The software accommodates enough cases that, should it be turned into a fully function application, there is minimal work needed to address an overall diverse user base. I learned a lot about prototyping software, and how it differs from other types of design software, as well as typical programming languages or IDEs. Beyond learning the ways in which a design should be both indicative of a purpose and functional to meet that end, I also learned a lot about working on a team where there are multiple types of tasks that need to be divided up. Prior experiences with teams were moreso about 4 people solving the same task together, as opposed to multiple people solving individual tasks to bring one larger project to life.  The chance to learn and grow around people who actually want me to learn and grow. I always strive for new experiences to come with knowledge and ideas that I can take away with me afterwards. While grinding away at a task just to get it done is entirely functional, I think that as an individual, I can both gain more and, subsequently, contribute more if I have room to improve and am encouraged to do so. I want to learn more about data transfer -- the way in which data moves from software to software, hardware to hardware, machine to person, and vice versa. Data itself is an abstract and system-agnostic thing, so the act of moving it between different mediums has always fascinated me, and I think a world where we welcome a more fluid transfer of data is a world that will learn and evolve a lot faster, and be more well-informed along the way. In terms of languages behind this, I suppose this primarily encompasses network-related frameworks. Well, as I mentioned in an earlier response, I try to make every experience into a learning experience. Surely there are times where the necessary thing is to just do a task the way it's always been done, but when it comes to problem solving, which is what programming is at its core, there's always room for something novel. I don't agree that learning needs to be time consuming, at least in a way that detracts from the primary tasks at hand. It's all about how you approach work itself, and that goes beyond programming. There's always room for something new, working and learning do not need to be exclusive. I have no prior experience with stacks, but given my current knowledge and skills, I'd likely go for MEAN. No. Yes. https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-cho-67299112a/ thanks.\"], [' Biggest project I worked on was a E-commerce database application which allowed consumers to place orders collectively on products that were to be order in mass quantity.

The telecommunication domain application helps business associates to refer how long does the provisioning of a service takes to assist them with actual customer ordering. The challenge was to create a ruling engine based on the different types of requirements and parameters. The same can be done with a messy complex logic or with an efficient rule based engine we deployed. The combination of rules are embedded as database entries and the variations of the rules will be evaluated by querying out and outputing the value, instead of endless conditional expressions.

The live EMS/Scada data was fed into the application and the application would reflect it in terms of MW consumed by the consumer. The appliation had a feature to forecast their energy needs based on previous consumption and predict live data. A key feature of the appliaction was messaging. We used ActiveMQ built on JMS and Topics for a publisher subscriber model and Queues for a point to point model. I worked on the ActiveMQ from scratch The company though huge and serves over to 400,000 consumers for their electricity needs. The IT team was relatively small and we had to bridge the gap of Business Analysts, we the team(6 people with 3 developers) would directly interract with the production managers gaining valuable business skills.

Although not actively used, we put a lot of effort into making the interface as usable and friendly as possible. Addionally we used command pattern throughout the project. Again, the above is my best example. We started with requirement elicitation, use cases, class diagram, etc. After that we made a framework for the program's structure with command pattern in mind. Before we began the actual process of coding, we pre-wrote all of the required tests for every function. During delvelopment, we frequently checked in with the customer (the professor) to make sure things were progressing as desired. Command pattern, the idea of pre-writing tests before coding begins and it was my first time going through the whole process of agile development.  C++ and C#. I like both with a preference towards C#. I like to think that C# feels like Java with the power of C++ behind it. Feels smooth, clean and fast. Additionally, C# can be used in a lot of places Java or C++ might not be able to be used, like webpages. I'd rather like to be in a position where I can have some sort of positive effect on people through the software I help develop. I'd like to learn more about AI and just programming in general. It's an ever changing field and that what I like about it, you can't stop learning. Usually I learn new things as they come up. I like to think that Google has been my best teacher. There's always a better solution, so I search it out and learn as much as I can along the way. This allows me to connect ideas together in new ways and apply them. To be honest, I'm not familiar with those tools. However that doesn't mean I cannot learn. If I were to be thrown into a situation where I'd have to use them, I'd ask. I'd ask the people who know better than me. I can't know everything, and neither can anyone else, but by asking I can at least learn from them to make better decisions in the future.

I do not know the exact figures. Earlier this year I developed a predictor for March Madness. It's a statistical analysis project written in Python. I first decided which data I would use and some ideologies that I wanted the model to keep true to. I then wrote the data collector and then the first version of the model itself. The predictor failed to meet expectations for the most recent tournament based on historical results. I realized some of the data I'm using includes tournament results and biases the model towards teams that did well in the tournament. Work on the predictor is ongoing with hopes to improve results for the next tournament. This project was my first foray into statistical analysis, so I learned about some of the Python libraries used in that.  I like that it's easy to jump into. You can start a project very easily, while still having access to many powerful libraries. I also enjoy the style of writing in Python. The most important thing that I'm looking for is that doing the work is interesting. More so than the end product, I want to enjoy the process of getting to the end product. I would be excited to learn anything new. I take pride in my ability to learn and use a variety of languages. My motivation to acquire new knowledge is simply to have that knowledge.

Currently, we're working on project to migrate customers from our existing legacy into the Hybris platform. Recently, I had to add fields to an view for the SAP Sql Business Objects app. I look over the request, realized that the request was older, and newer fields were added to primary table since the request was submitted. I followed up with business analyst to confirm names, and add the newer fields not previously on the request. Gotten approval, compiled changes in test environment, and ran both Unit and regression tests. Upon completion, moved changes to preprod environment for business analyst for final review. At same time, coordinated with another engineer to add fields directly in Business Objects so that business analyst can review. Analyst approved changes and currently scheduled for upcoming code deployment by separate deployment team. Once deployed, analyst will do final validation in production and give signoff.

I had to use Hadoop, AI techniques like SVM, Particle Swarm Optimization(Genetic algorithm), Fuzzy C-Means, core Java, NLP techniques to clean and prepare(tokenize) newspaper articles from multiple languages and to convert them to English. \\n\\nIn short, the task was to collect newspaper articles from 3 languages, convert them to English and create a mini search engine which will find the documents and then redirect to its origin language. Since there were many articles, I had to use Hadoop. The most recent project that I handled all by myself was an Android app. One day I had an idea - how about we create a summary of a journey from point A to point B without the user doing anything else. So I started from scratch, got used to the Android environment and made a lot of mistakes. Since I was the only person handling it, many bugs were found in the first version which took about 2 months(as I was completing my Masters along with the project). The biggest hurdle was to create a video illusion using programming given that I have all co-ordinates of that vehicle/person from point A to point B and I didn\\' I am completing the last answer here. \"find anything online.

Coming to this question - My main aim of Masters and to come to US was to get accustomed to AI/Machine Learning. SO in the past 2 years I took 8 out of 10 courses in ML/AI. It was challenging in the beginning but I got the hold of it by the end as new frameworks seem to pop out everyday and its not worth it to learn each one. However, I achieved what I wanted - to understand under the hood workings of AI and its use in real life applications  Because its compact and its usually the language of AI frameworks, however there are Java frameworks too I am a recent graduate, but I want to learn as much as possible and take on responsibility along with a little guidance from the experienced coders.

Recently I worked on a project that searched the ticket master API for events in a given location and allowed the user to filter through the events.  It was made using Angular and relied on a flask backend to search the API.  We first created the Angular frontend with test data to make sure the application had a usable interface, then created the flask backend to be able to handle the API calls and pass over the data. That project introduced me to Angular and allowed me to understand how to create a usable web application.  I also learned CSS, HTML and Javascript during that project to use in the Angular platform.

Knowing the 'why', and creating a route from that starting point has been a great lesson. With customer support teams, there can be times when the energy may become dull due to the nature of the department- complaints, concerns, etc. Taking time to see the positives, and recognizing teammates does a lot to boost morale. While managing the customer advocacy team at Vital, it was high stress as the company was scaling so fast. End of day check-ins worked well to hear everyone's grievances, and start the next day on positive footing.

Two week post purchase check-ins are an appreciated KPI.

My entire career has been in customer service, in one way or another. I spent about 6 years working in Hospitality with a majority of that time spent with Marriott. I grew a very solid foundation of customer service skills working for this company and have continued to utilize that training throughout my career. After working in the hospitality industry, I completely pivoted to a tech startup where I was an Account Consultant, helping service customers and their web based businesses. After spending a couple of years there, I did leave the company because there were no growth opportunities at the time. I ended up getting a teaching position in China and uprooted myself for a year of teaching and travel throughout Asia. When I came back, I jumped right into the tech start up scene again with a position at Belly Card where I was a part of the 7-11 team. I had my hand in a lot of different projects and support aspects there before I was laid off. Following that I was at another start up in the commercial cleaning industry as an Account Manager as well as Operations Manager. And now to my current role at Snapsheet where I have been for almost 2 years. I'm currently a Customer Success Manager for our Inbound call team, as well as manage 4 of our other managers. No. I do not have direct experience with marketing technology. No I started my career in the Hotel industry. When I moved into tech it was with SingleHop, which sells servers. At Belly Card we sold a tech platform for digital loyalty. At OfficeLuv we had a tech solution for office supply replenishment and cleaning services. At SnapSheet we have a tech platform to expedite the claims process for auto accidents.  The ease of being able to house all of a clients information in one spot, including email communications, appointment dates, and services they are subscribed to. It's a great one-stop-shop for their data. I am very proud of the team I'm currently coaching. It's a team of 15 individuals who service our incoming call volume to the company. It can be a high stress position due to the volume of calls we service, and not knowing the nature of what that inbound call is going to entail. I had the opportunity of launching our very first inbound team last summer, and am incredibly proud to be able to look back and see where we are today because going in we didn't know what to expect. It took a lot of trial and error to understand how we needed to service our customers, how many agents we needed staffed, and what specific phone Q's we needed to add. Those that helped in it's launch knew going in that it was going to be kind of crazy, but we knew that together we'd get through it. And we did. Today we have built out better processes surrounding what our Inbound team looks like and the service that we give to our customers. We have the highest QA scores amongst the rest of the organization, and that is something that I take great pride in. That I am able to give them the support that they need to be successful, and that I can coach to our quality standards. I liken customer retention to employee retention. Even your top performers need to have the same touch points as your low performers, because once you get comfortable and think they're solid with where there at, that's when the problems start. It's important to make sure that metrics are in place for each account, growth milestones, and to have proper communication cadence in place to stay ahead of the ball. I think it's important for a customer to feel like you are their go-to person, and that they can trust you. At the end of the day, we are all humans, and making that human connection with a client is going to do wonders for the overall health of the account. The most important thing is having tools in place to be able to do my job well. One of the most challenging things that I currently go through is not having those tools, and trying to make the best out of what I do. For example, there are a lot of inconsistencies with data which makes it difficult for us to be able to forecast accurately for business needs. Oftentimes when going through employee reviews, the tools we have to support their performance is lacking. Additionally, clear growth and variety in work is very important to me.

We've been able to come in and turn around the customer sentiment, keep people on the platform, and we grew the existing client base by over 10% last year.

I look at things like how many people are using the product at a given client, who sees the data, how often, how many different departments are seeing value - how deep are our roots.  It's important to track how they are using the system, are they using it at a very basic level, do they have all the bells and whistles, are they using the system in the way it was designed, are they engaging in feedback loops to constantly improve the product.

I started working in customer service in 1998 with Shoe Carnival, where I established a reputation for being able to build strong rapport with the customers. I started out as a sales associate, then was promoted to the position of floor supervisor. In 2000 I took a position with Wireless retail as an implementation manager, and in that role I worked with employees in five state region teaching best customer service practices and working to staff out locations with the best candidates available. In 2010 I embarked on a career path in higher education as an admissions advisor, the role of admissions advisor requires one to have excellent customer service and relationship building skills while being able to gain an understanding of client needs and being able to articulate a path to help them reach career and life goals. I followed that path to Career Education Corporation, and then on the Adler University where I has able to add to my skill set and learn how to best meet customer need. The career experience in addition to my educational background in business management have allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the customer success field, while learning how to be effective in leadership and helping to train and inspire others to work as a team to reach organizational goals. Yes  I like that Salesforce is a custom designed CRM that is implemented with the specific needs of the organization that is using it. Salesforce is easily navigable and helps to manage a large data base of leads. The last team I lead was with Career Education Corporation where I functioned as a department lead, my specific team consisted of eight advisors and I was tasked with developing best practices that lead to the better handling of leads, timely follow up, and superior customer service. We were able to routinely hit our monthly enrollment targets and stand out among other teams that we were compared to. I am most proud of the camaraderie that we developed as a team, and the way we were able to utilize the talents of each team member to meet our goals. My approach to managing customer health is the building of relationships with the customers we interact with, many times the area of opportunity that is missed is building the necessary rapport with the client base. It is imperative that the customer can feel that the person(s) that they are interacting with has a genuine care for them and the service that they are being provided. Metrics are key, measuring factors like customers contacted in a work day, timely follow up, and product knowledge all lead to good customer health. Ultimately thins factors can be positively effected by leaders paying attention to detail, and taking time to cultivate and develop their team.

Currently as Vice President of Business Consulting for Bank of America Merchant Services, I currently lead a team of Business Analysts, Account Managers, Product Specialists, and Inside Sales reps. In 2017, my team finished first amongst the 13 VPs in the Specialized Industry division, and we were #8 overall in the entire company out of about a dozen of teams. My approach is monitoring key metrics such as overall product usage, depth of usage, breadth of usage, account growth, customer account lifespan, renewals achieved, upsell numbers, survey results/ customer feedback, customer's executives' relationship with my company, and customer support performance. These KPIs and metrics help determine the direction of everything from customer support to sales, product development, and overall company direction; they provide insight and influence all aspects of a business. Achieving these goals is possible through continuous training, building relationships with customers through positivity in every interaction, complete understanding of the product and industry trends to become a trusted advisor and expert in the eyes of the customer, proper usage of internal systems, effective cross-department collaboration, and constantly refining our processes.

It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table. As I've said, my most recent project was the reimbursement site. I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked. I've learned about how to use servlets and AJAX calls to get databases and websites working together, and how to connect to databases from Java. I've also learned that JavaScript can be too lenient for the programmer's own good.  I like that python is relatively simple, but also highly versatile. I also like the dictionary collection type, as i find that the key-value pairings make organizing and retrieving data much simpler (I've got to explore this advantage in detail in an Information Retrieval course I took in Spring). Mostly I'm just happy to have an opportunity to learn more about software development and gain more experience that will help me in the industry. I admit that I am unfamiliar with .Net programs, which I've seen come up on a few job postings, so I feel that it's something I could use. I also would like to learn more about Angular, which I've only touched upon. I feel that it helps when I have some sort of deadline to meet.

To talk about the most complex project, I should tell you about the one that I worked on when I started off my graduate studies. I developed an algorithm to find the shortest path between any 2 stations in New York subway. I had to gather all the maps pertaining to the subway system. And I found out all the junction points where we can make transfers to different lines. I had to make sure that I didn't miss even a single junction point, as that would lead to miscalculations. I applied Dijkstra's algorithm for that project. And I developed the project using Java. But, I tried out other languages to improve my knowledge. Sure.  I like the versatility of the language. One can literally do wonders with Python. It covers various domains that I can work on. And there are so many libraries that make my work easier. I've always searched for new things to learn and challenges to face. The projects that I work on are chosen keeping that in mind. That being said, I'm looking for new opportunities to showcase my skills, solve complex problems and grow along with the organization. There are 2 things that I'd like to try my hands on. One being the different frameworks of Javascript, as there's a plethora out there. And the other being mobile app development: iOS and Android. I've chosen this field as my career because I find it interesting and challenging. I know for a fact that I have to dedicate my life to it if I have to be successful. That being said, I believe one shouldn't search for time or motivation to acquire new knowledge, as it is implicit that one should focus on this at all times.

Most of my clients were well renounced banks in Nepal. I had to retrieve datas from UI such as android apps with the use of JSON. And manipulate those data into the banks system. So the most resent project I had to work for was another banking system which uses a kind of online payment method which is similar to what PayPal does. Had to incorporate that into online transaction through the bank itself. Retrieving information on the account used to make the purchase and handling data security was something I was in charge of. I learned how to make the system more secured and to decrease the runtime of the program itself so that the process was smooth and had a good flow. I learnt more about restful server while working on this project. I also learnt about the flow towards the backend of the system. I found that the entire task should not fall back on the UI side but also the backend of the system to make the software you have designed more stable and secure.

I am one of 2 primary programmers on the job, the other programmer being in charge of determining what we need, and myself primarily filling in those needs. The last project I was present for from beginning to end is a front-end design for a UX course. I, along with 2 others, were responsible from coming up with an application idea and implementing the agile process to get a prototype finished and polished. Being more hands-on that conceptual myself, I took responsibility for translating our needs into designs, and our designs into a program. The software accommodates enough cases that, should it be turned into a fully function application, there is minimal work needed to address an overall diverse user base. I learned a lot about prototyping software, and how it differs from other types of design software, as well as typical programming languages or IDEs. Beyond learning the ways in which a design should be both indicative of a purpose and functional to meet that end, I also learned a lot about working on a team where there are multiple types of tasks that need to be divided up. Prior experiences with teams were moreso about 4 people solving the same task together, as opposed to multiple people solving individual tasks to bring one larger project to life.  The chance to learn and grow around people who actually want me to learn and grow. I always strive for new experiences to come with knowledge and ideas that I can take away with me afterwards. While grinding away at a task just to get it done is entirely functional, I think that as an individual, I can both gain more and, subsequently, contribute more if I have room to improve and am encouraged to do so. I want to learn more about data transfer -- the way in which data moves from software to software, hardware to hardware, machine to person, and vice versa. Data itself is an abstract and system-agnostic thing, so the act of moving it between different mediums has always fascinated me, and I think a world where we welcome a more fluid transfer of data is a world that will learn and evolve a lot faster, and be more well-informed along the way. In terms of languages behind this, I suppose this primarily encompasses network-related frameworks. Well, as I mentioned in an earlier response, I try to make every experience into a learning experience. Surely there are times where the necessary thing is to just do a task the way it's always been done, but when it comes to problem solving, which is what programming is at its core, there's always room for something novel. I don't agree that learning needs to be time consuming, at least in a way that detracts from the primary tasks at hand. It's all about how you approach work itself, and that goes beyond programming. There's always room for something new, working and learning do not need to be exclusive. I have no prior experience with stacks, but given my current knowledge and skills, I'd likely go for MEAN.

The project would allow them to give an interface on how they would be handling their energy needs. The live EMS/Scada data was fed into the application and the application would reflect it in terms of MW consumed by the consumer. The appliation had a feature to forecast their energy needs based on previous consumption and predict live data. A key feature of the appliaction was messaging. We used ActiveMQ built on JMS and Topics for a publisher subscriber model and Queues for a point to point model. I worked on the ActiveMQ from scratch The company though huge and serves over to 400,000 consumers for their electricity needs. The IT team was relatively small and we had to bridge the gap of Business Analysts, we the team(6 people with 3 developers) would directly interract with the production managers gaining valuable business skills. We were involved in deploying the application on the servers too, using load balancers, procuring servers thus bridging the gap of the Operational Team too. It was a very goid learning experience.

Again, the above is my best example. We started with requirement elicitation, use cases, class diagram, etc. After that we made a framework for the program's structure with command pattern in mind.

So I started from scratch, got used to the Android environment and made a lot of mistakes. Since I was the only person handling it, many bugs were found in the first version which took about 2 months(as I was completing my Masters along with the project).

Customer success has played a large part in my professional background- close to eight years. As an esthetician, a positive customer experience means everything, including repeat income and new customers. At Vital Proteins I began my career as the Customer Advocacy Manager, where I implemented new procedures and built out the entire team. From there, I moved into a sales manager role overseeing all beauty accounts. While all roles had their differences, customer success is always at the forefont. at a high level yes   yes While at Vital Proteins we used sales force CRM software to gather metrics, customer analytics, etc to get a greater idea of our consumer and the best methods of interaction. However, we inevitable phased out the software and developed a customized portal. Leading with education and a positive approach is my management philosophy. Knowing the 'why', and creating a route from that starting point has been a great lesson. With customer support teams, there can be times when the energy may become dull due to the nature of the department- complaints, concerns, etc. Taking time to see the positives, and recognizing teammates does a lot to boost morale. While managing the customer advocacy team at Vital, it was high stress as the company was scaling so fast. End of day check-ins worked well to hear everyone's grievances, and start the next day on positive footing. A milestone would be gaining placement in large national retailers like Anthropologie and Nordstrom. Leading a team that helped put a tasting menu presentation together took a great deal of planning in terms of logistics and education. By delegating tasks and trusting my teams ability we were able to be successful. Organization is key! Calendars and spreadsheets are essential to not only keep track, but schedule follow-ups. Two week post purchase check-ins are an appreciated KPI. Checking in with a customer to see how they are enjoying the product, how it is selling, if they have questions,etc. showcases your caring approach to the relationship and instills trust. General account management principles of: increase current usage, stimulate new users, reduce customer churn provide great guidance at a high level. Monthly and Annual recurring revenue metrics are essential when considering retention from a monetary standpoint as well. I am looking to grow and learn in my career. Working with a company I can expand my skill set with, and stay with for the long term is a goal of mine. I truly enjoy working, and a positive company culture makes it all the more appealing.

My entire career has been in customer service, in one way or another. I spent about 6 years working in Hospitality with a majority of that time spent with Marriott. I grew a very solid foundation of customer service skills working for this company and have continued to utilize that training throughout my career. After working in the hospitality industry, I completely pivoted to a tech startup where I was an Account Consultant, helping service customers and their web based businesses. After spending a couple of years there, I did leave the company because there were no growth opportunities at the time. I ended up getting a teaching position in China and uprooted myself for a year of teaching and travel throughout Asia. When I came back, I jumped right into the tech start up scene again with a position at Belly Card where I was a part of the 7-11 team. I had my hand in a lot of different projects and support aspects there before I was laid off. Following that I was at another start up in the commercial cleaning industry as an Account Manager as well as Operations Manager. And now to my current role at Snapsheet where I have been for almost 2 years. I'm currently a Customer Success Manager for our Inbound call team, as well as manage 4 of our other managers. No. I do not have direct experience with marketing technology. No I started my career in the Hotel industry. When I moved into tech it was with SingleHop, which sells servers. At Belly Card we sold a tech platform for digital loyalty. At OfficeLuv we had a tech solution for office supply replenishment and cleaning services. At SnapSheet we have a tech platform to expedite the claims process for auto accidents.  The ease of being able to house all of a clients information in one spot, including email communications, appointment dates, and services they are subscribed to. It's a great one-stop-shop for their data. I am very proud of the team I'm currently coaching. It's a team of 15 individuals who service our incoming call volume to the company. It can be a high stress position due to the volume of calls we service, and not knowing the nature of what that inbound call is going to entail. I had the opportunity of launching our very first inbound team last summer, and am incredibly proud to be able to look back and see where we are today because going in we didn't know what to expect. It took a lot of trial and error to understand how we needed to service our customers, how many agents we needed staffed, and what specific phone Q's we needed to add. Those that helped in it's launch knew going in that it was going to be kind of crazy, but we knew that together we'd get through it. And we did. Today we have built out better processes surrounding what our Inbound team looks like and the service that we give to our customers. We have the highest QA scores amongst the rest of the organization, and that is something that I take great pride in. That I am able to give them the support that they need to be successful, and that I can coach to our quality standards. I liken customer retention to employee retention. Even your top performers need to have the same touch points as your low performers, because once you get comfortable and think they're solid with where there at, that's when the problems start. It's important to make sure that metrics are in place for each account, growth milestones, and to have proper communication cadence in place to stay ahead of the ball. I think it's important for a customer to feel like you are their go-to person, and that they can trust you. At the end of the day, we are all humans, and making that human connection with a client is going to do wonders for the overall health of the account. The most important thing is having tools in place to be able to do my job well. One of the most challenging things that I currently go through is not having those tools, and trying to make the best out of what I do. For example, there are a lot of inconsistencies with data which makes it difficult for us to be able to forecast accurately for business needs. Oftentimes when going through employee reviews, the tools we have to support their performance is lacking. Additionally, clear growth and variety in work is very important to me.

We've been able to come in and turn around the customer sentiment, keep people on the platform, and we grew the existing client base by over 10% last year.

I look at things like how many people are using the product at a given client, who sees the data, how often, how many different departments are seeing value - how deep are our roots.  It's important to track how they are using the system, are they using it at a very basic level, do they have all the bells and whistles, are they using the system in the way it was designed, are they engaging in feedback loops to constantly improve the product.

Currently as Vice President of Business Consulting for Bank of America Merchant Services, I currently lead a team of Business Analysts, Account Managers, Product Specialists, and Inside Sales reps. In 2017, my team finished first amongst the 13 VPs in the Specialized Industry division, and we were #8 overall in the entire company out of about a dozen of teams. My approach is monitoring key metrics such as overall product usage, depth of usage, breadth of usage, account growth, customer account lifespan, renewals achieved, upsell numbers, survey results/ customer feedback, customer's executives' relationship with my company, and customer support performance. These KPIs and metrics help determine the direction of everything from customer support to sales, product development, and overall company direction; they provide insight and influence all aspects of a business. Achieving these goals is possible through continuous training, building relationships with customers through positivity in every interaction, complete understanding of the product and industry trends to become a trusted advisor and expert in the eyes of the customer, proper usage of internal systems, effective cross-department collaboration, and constantly refining our processes.

My secret is perspective. It is very easy to become overwhelmed with client requests and projects, but being able to see how each aspect fits into the larger picture, and then prioritize accordingly, is key. If you take a step back you may realize that an issue/task may not seem as urgent as it first seemed. No I have not worked for a software directly, but I have used software in nearly all aspects of my jobs. Salesforce.com, SQL, Microsoft Office, and Google Suite are all vital tools I use everyday. Without these amazing tools, my day-to-day would be significantly more time consuming and stressful. Software is essential to scale/streamline nearly every business.  I believe the biggest reason customers leave is due to poorly set expectations. Whether expectations are set during the sales or onboarding process, that is where you should really take the time to set yourself and the customer up for success. The motto I take to heart for my current role is \"Under-promise and over-deliver\". I\\'ve used a wide range of softwares to present and train customers on a product. They include Salesforce.com, Microsoft Powerpoint, Google Slides, and Uber\\'s own proprietary software. My most recent experience was when I was an Onboarding Specialist for Uber Eats. I visited restaurants in-person, walked them through our software/app and how to accept orders, as well as presenting them with ket tips to set their restaurant up for success. In addition to that, I would have answers/examples planned out ahead of time for any potential questions they may have. Absolutely!

After closing the deal it would then be my responsibility to ensure a smooth on-boarding process for the client, then pass the account on to the account manager to oversee.  At Townsquare, we presented using PowerPoint. One of the most exciting parts about the job was finally getting to sit down with someone one on one.
