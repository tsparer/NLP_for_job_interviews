It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table.\",\n",

I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked.\",\n",

Once the functionality was figured out there via different mocha tests, an HTML page was set up to keep track of user logs and to keep it contained within the individual chats.

It is a mature language and it has been open sourced for a while now thus allowing a nice large community to be formed and the software they build to be compatible with Java. This would provide us the ability to be flexible with our software choices if need be in the future. With regards to the front-end we can use the tried and tested such HTML, CSS, Javascript and their related frameworks. With regards to Javascript right now React can be used if we looking for a more lightweight, option else we can go for Angular. For the relational database, there are a variety of solutions available such as SQL Server, Oracle SQL. I would suggest we use .NET related if we focusing on using Microsft related tech for the most part.',\n",

It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table.\",\n",
       "  \"As I've said, my most recent project was the reimbursement site. I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked.\",\n",

It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table.\",\n",

I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that.

After working in the hospitality industry, I completely pivoted to a tech startup where I was an Account Consultant, helping service customers and their web based businesses. After spending a couple of years there, I did leave the company because there were no growth opportunities at the time. I ended up getting a teaching position in China and uprooted myself for a year of teaching and travel throughout Asia. When I came back, I jumped right into the tech start up scene again with a position at Belly Card where I was a part of the 7-11 team. I had my hand in a lot of different projects and support aspects there before I was laid off. Following that I was at another start up in the commercial cleaning industry as an Account Manager as well as Operations Manager.

       " 1: \" In terms of complexity, I would have to say the Reimbursement Site I've recently completed as a training project. It had over a dozen Java files, nearly a dozen HTML pages, and several AJAX methods, along with a simple SQL database. It implemented front-end pages using HTML, JavaScript, and most notably AJAX calls to tie it with the rest of the program. It passed or requested any info to/from one of two servlets, one to update the SQL database and one to retrieve a query result. Both pass the info to a single request helper, which redirected the calls to an appropriate controller. These controllers called DAO methods that accessed the database and retrieved/altered the data as need be. The database consisted of two tables, one sequence, and one procedure to add new values to the second table. As I've said, my most recent project was the reimbursement site. I took a good look at the requirements, and reviewed samples of servlets, front controllers, and AJAX calls to figure out how to get HTML, Java, SQL and JavaScript all working together. Then I wrote out a good chunk of the code before testing it (admittedly not my best idea), and when I did test it, it didn't even login properly. I debugged by tracing the error to the request helper, where I found that the URI was not set up right, so I fixed that. Then I found a problem with a retrieval method, which I traced to a typo in an AJAX call. And I kept developing and debugging until I got the site to work properly. Then I gave a short demonstration as to how it worked. I've learned about how to use servlets and AJAX calls to get databases and websites working together, and how to connect to databases from Java. I've also learned that JavaScript can be too lenient for the programmer's own good.  I like that python is relatively simple, but also highly versatile. I also like the dictionary collection type, as i find that the key-value pairings make organizing and retrieving data much simpler (I've got to explore this advantage in detail in an Information Retrieval course I took in Spring). Mostly I'm just happy to have an opportunity to learn more about software development and gain more experience that will help me in the industry. I admit that I am unfamiliar with .Net programs, which I've seen come up on a few job postings, so I feel that it's something I could use. I also would like to learn more about Angular, which I've only touched upon. I feel that it helps when I have some sort of deadline to meet. Say I have a project that requires me to use knowledge I don't have, so I'll try to find examples of that knowledge in action, in pieces if I must, and work from that to get my program working.

On the project we were asked to set up different objects for both those chatting and the rooms that they would be entering\\n\\nFrom the beginning, you were only primarily concerned with the people in the chat, them being unique to an array of different javascript users and being contained in their own chat room. Once the functionality was figured out there via different mocha tests, an HTML page was set up to keep track of user logs and to keep it contained within the individual chats. For added fun, we added a feature that would send our location, in much the same way that a real client keeps track of your location The best part of the process was that it was centered around the front end of a Node.js project. Most of the new skills I learned were centered around that framework, with a bit of exposure to jQuery and how to use the fields on the page to extract data to different objects.\\n\\nIn a lot of ways, Javascript and the accompanying technologies are very open-ended to use, but it all seems very portable to since it can function for both personal and enterprise projects  The most ideal thing that I look for with a new opportunity is having the right people in place to help foster my growth as a programmer and more importantly as a problem solver.

I believe I can answer this questions of yours based on the projects that I've worked on. To talk about the most complex project, I should tell you about the one that I worked on when I started off my graduate studies. I developed an algorithm to find the shortest path between any 2 stations in New York subway. I had to gather all the maps pertaining to the subway system. And I found out all the junction points where we can make transfers to different lines. I had to make sure that I didn't miss even a single junction point, as that would lead to miscalculations. I applied Dijkstra's algorithm for that project. And I developed the project using Java. But, I tried out other languages to improve my knowledge. Sure.  I like the versatility of the language. One can literally do wonders with Python. It covers various domains that I can work on. And there are so many libraries that make my work easier. I've always searched for new things to learn and challenges to face. The projects that I work on are chosen keeping that in mind. That being said, I'm looking for new opportunities to showcase my skills, solve complex problems and grow along with the organization. There are 2 things that I'd like to try my hands on. One being the different frameworks of Javascript, as there's a plethora out there. And the other being mobile app development: iOS and Android. I've chosen this field as my career because I find it interesting and challenging. I know for a fact that I have to dedicate my life to it if I have to be successful. That being said, I believe one shouldn't search for time or motivation to acquire new knowledge, as it is implicit that one should focus on this at all times. To be frank, I've used Azure more than AWS. However, picking the right tools depends only on 2 factors, according to me. They are: 1.The problem we are dealing with, and, 2.

I had to retrieve datas from UI such as android apps with the use of JSON. And manipulate those data into the banks system. So the most resent project I had to work for was another banking system which uses a kind of online payment method which is similar to what PayPal does. Had to incorporate that into online transaction through the bank itself. Retrieving information on the account used to make the purchase and handling data security was something I was in charge of. I learned how to make the system more secured and to decrease the runtime of the program itself so that the process was smooth and had a good flow. I learnt more about restful server while working on this project. I also learnt about the flow towards the backend of the system. I found that the entire task should not fall back on the UI side but also the backend of the system to make the software you have designed more stable and secure.  I like that the code is not as complex to use and in a Linux system it does wonders. I’m all about using c programming on a Linux system but python helped me cut down so much of the coding process because of its features. I’m all about team work and communication when I’m working on a project. I feel like it’s one of the main aspect to help build a company. I also look forward towards proper planning and management while working on a project. In addition to that as technology keeps on updating itself so I feel like it’s important for a company to crate a good learning environment as well.

       " 25: \" The biggest project software project I've worked on is a game project currently under development by myself and 3 other associates. I am one of 2 primary programmers on the job, the other programmer being in charge of determining what we need, and myself primarily filling in those needs. The last project I was present for from beginning to end is a front-end design for a UX course. I, along with 2 others, were responsible from coming up with an application idea and implementing the agile process to get a prototype finished and polished. Being more hands-on that conceptual myself, I took responsibility for translating our needs into designs, and our designs into a program. The software accommodates enough cases that, should it be turned into a fully function application, there is minimal work needed to address an overall diverse user base. I learned a lot about prototyping software, and how it differs from other types of design software, as well as typical programming languages or IDEs. Beyond learning the ways in which a design should be both indicative of a purpose and functional to meet that end, I also learned a lot about working on a team where there are multiple types of tasks that need to be divided up. Prior experiences with teams were moreso about 4 people solving the same task together, as opposed to multiple people solving individual tasks to bring one larger project to life.  The chance to learn and grow around people who actually want me to learn and grow. I always strive for new experiences to come with knowledge and ideas that I can take away with me afterwards. While grinding away at a task just to get it done is entirely functional, I think that as an individual, I can both gain more and, subsequently, contribute more if I have room to improve and am encouraged to do so. I want to learn more about data transfer -- the way in which data moves from software to software, hardware to hardware, machine to person, and vice versa. Data itself is an abstract and system-agnostic thing, so the act of moving it between different mediums has always fascinated me, and I think a world where we welcome a more fluid transfer of data is a world that will learn and evolve a lot faster, and be more well-informed along the way. In terms of languages behind this, I suppose this primarily encompasses network-related frameworks. Well, as I mentioned in an earlier response, I try to make every experience into a learning experience. Surely there are times where the necessary thing is to just do a task the way it's always been done, but when it comes to problem solving, which is what programming is at its core, there's always room for something novel. I don't agree that learning needs to be time consuming, at least in a way that detracts from the primary tasks at hand. It's all about how you approach work itself, and that goes beyond programming. There's always room for something new, working and learning do not need to be exclusive. I have no prior experience with stacks, but given my current knowledge and skills, I'd likely go for MEAN.

The project titled nipsrate was designed specifically for the company's Industrial customers. These were huge conglomerates and manufacturing companies the utility serves to. The project would allow them to give an interface on how they would be handling their energy needs. The live EMS/Scada data was fed into the application and the application would reflect it in terms of MW consumed by the consumer. The appliation had a feature to forecast their energy needs based on previous consumption and predict live data. A key feature of the appliaction was messaging. We used ActiveMQ built on JMS and Topics for a publisher subscriber model and Queues for a point to point model. I worked on the ActiveMQ from scratch The company though huge and serves over to 400,000 consumers for their electricity needs. The IT team was relatively small and we had to bridge the gap of Business Analysts, we the team(6 people with 3 developers) would directly interract with the production managers gaining valuable business skills. We were involved in deploying the application on the servers too, using load balancers, procuring servers thus bridging the gap of the Operational Team too. It was a very goid learning experience. The application in itself involved heavily on  Spring MVC, RESTful webservices, Spring IOC, Spring Security, JPA, Hibernate ORM, Oracle DB, ActiveMQ, HandsonTables, Json data processing, JSP, JavaScript,Mustache Js  Yes JavaScript is very lightweight and helps in reducing the redundancy in the server calls. My ideal role would be a FullStack Java Developer role with a focus on backend. I have used Spring Boot and Spring MicroServices and they really help in transforming the Applications Performance and is a developer's dream. The spring framework speaks to me. Learning and growing in my career would be the role Im looking for .net I want to bridge the gap between the java and .net languages and be agile to either Deducation and motivation is the key So my ideal stack would be using a good build tool like Maven or Gradle.

Although not actively used, we put a lot of effort into making the interface as usable and friendly as possible. Addionally we used command pattern throughout the project. Again, the above is my best example. We started with requirement elicitation, use cases, class diagram, etc. After that we made a framework for the program's structure with command pattern in mind. Before we began the actual process of coding, we pre-wrote all of the required tests for every function. During delvelopment, we frequently checked in with the customer (the professor) to make sure things were progressing as desired. Command pattern, the idea of pre-writing tests before coding begins and it was my first time going through the whole process of agile development.  C++ and C#. I like both with a preference towards C#. I like to think that C# feels like Java with the power of C++ behind it. Feels smooth, clean and fast.

There's always a better solution, so I search it out and learn as much as I can along the way. This allows me to connect ideas together in new ways and apply them. To be honest, I'm not familiar with those tools. However that doesn't mean I cannot learn. If I were to be thrown into a situation where I'd have to use them, I'd ask. I'd ask the people who know better than me. I can't know everything, and neither can anyone else, but by asking I can at least learn from them to make better decisions in the future.

Earlier this year I developed a predictor for March Madness. It's a statistical analysis project written in Python. I first decided which data I would use and some ideologies that I wanted the model to keep true to. I then wrote the data collector and then the first version of the model itself. The predictor failed to meet expectations for the most recent tournament based on historical results. I realized some of the data I'm using includes tournament results and biases the model towards teams that did well in the tournament. Work on the predictor is ongoing with hopes to improve results for the next tournament. This project was my first foray into statistical analysis, so I learned about some of the Python libraries used in that.  I like that it's easy to jump into.

Currently, we're working on project to migrate customers from our existing legacy into the Hybris platform.

I followed up with business analyst to confirm names, and add the newer fields not previously on the request. Gotten approval, compiled changes in test environment, and ran both Unit and regression tests. Upon completion, moved changes to preprod environment for business analyst for final review.

I had to use Hadoop, AI techniques like SVM, Particle Swarm Optimization(Genetic algorithm), Fuzzy C-Means, core Java, NLP techniques to clean and prepare(tokenize) newspaper articles from multiple languages and to convert them to English. \\n\\nIn short, the task was to collect newspaper articles from 3 languages, convert them to English and create a mini search engine which will find the documents and then redirect to its origin language. Since there were many articles, I had to use Hadoop. The most recent project that I handled all by myself was an Android app. One day I had an idea - how about we create a summary of a journey from point A to point B without the user doing anything else. So I started from scratch, got used to the Android environment and made a lot of mistakes. Since I was the only person handling it, many bugs were found in the first version which took about 2 months(as I was completing my Masters along with the project).

As an esthetician, a positive customer experience means everything, including repeat income and new customers. At Vital Proteins I began my career as the Customer Advocacy Manager, where I implemented new procedures and built out the entire team. From there, I moved into a sales manager role overseeing all beauty accounts. While all roles had their differences, customer success is always at the forefont. at a high level yes   yes While at Vital Proteins we used sales force CRM software to gather metrics, customer analytics, etc to get a greater idea of our consumer and the best methods of interaction. However, we inevitable phased out the software and developed a customized portal. Leading with education and a positive approach is my management philosophy. Knowing the 'why', and creating a route from that starting point has been a great lesson. With customer support teams, there can be times when the energy may become dull due to the nature of the department- complaints, concerns, etc. Taking time to see the positives, and recognizing teammates does a lot to boost morale. While managing the customer advocacy team at Vital, it was high stress as the company was scaling so fast. End of day check-ins worked well to hear everyone's grievances, and start the next day on positive footing. A milestone would be gaining placement in large national retailers like Anthropologie and Nordstrom. Leading a team that helped put a tasting menu presentation together took a great deal of planning in terms of logistics and education. By delegating tasks and trusting my teams ability we were able to be successful. Organization is key! Calendars and spreadsheets are essential to not only keep track, but schedule follow-ups. Two week post purchase check-ins are an appreciated KPI. Checking in with a customer to see how they are enjoying the product, how it is selling, if they have questions,etc. showcases your caring approach to the relationship and instills trust. General account management principles of: increase current usage, stimulate new users, reduce customer churn provide great guidance at a high level. Monthly and Annual recurring revenue metrics are essential when considering retention from a monetary standpoint as well. I am looking to grow and learn in my career. Working with a company I can expand my skill set with, and stay with for the long term is a goal of mine. I truly enjoy working, and a positive company culture makes it all the more appealing.

I had the great opportunity of hiring the our first Account Manager, helped grow ARR to 1M+ USD and created and produced the company\\'s first annual conference:  Print Husters Conf. My approach to managing customer health is to be proactive. Meaning, digging deep into analytics and learning client stories to have a more personal and consultative relationship. Key metrics include, but are not limited to:  customer acquisition/retention cost, MRR, churn rates and customer lifetime value. Understanding the full customer profile(s) allows me to create made-to-measure processes and strategies that will drive the company\\'s overall success.

       " 119: \" Ok! My entire career has been in customer service, in one way or another. I spent about 6 years working in Hospitality with a majority of that time spent with Marriott. I grew a very solid foundation of customer service skills working for this company and have continued to utilize that training throughout my career. After working in the hospitality industry, I completely pivoted to a tech startup where I was an Account Consultant, helping service customers and their web based businesses. After spending a couple of years there, I did leave the company because there were no growth opportunities at the time. I ended up getting a teaching position in China and uprooted myself for a year of teaching and travel throughout Asia. When I came back, I jumped right into the tech start up scene again with a position at Belly Card where I was a part of the 7-11 team. I had my hand in a lot of different projects and support aspects there before I was laid off. Following that I was at another start up in the commercial cleaning industry as an Account Manager as well as Operations Manager. And now to my current role at Snapsheet where I have been for almost 2 years. I'm currently a Customer Success Manager for our Inbound call team, as well as manage 4 of our other managers. No. I do not have direct experience with marketing technology. No I started my career in the Hotel industry. When I moved into tech it was with SingleHop, which sells servers. At Belly Card we sold a tech platform for digital loyalty. At OfficeLuv we had a tech solution for office supply replenishment and cleaning services. At SnapSheet we have a tech platform to expedite the claims process for auto accidents.  The ease of being able to house all of a clients information in one spot, including email communications, appointment dates, and services they are subscribed to. It's a great one-stop-shop for their data. I am very proud of the team I'm currently coaching. It's a team of 15 individuals who service our incoming call volume to the company. It can be a high stress position due to the volume of calls we service, and not knowing the nature of what that inbound call is going to entail. I had the opportunity of launching our very first inbound team last summer, and am incredibly proud to be able to look back and see where we are today because going in we didn't know what to expect. It took a lot of trial and error to understand how we needed to service our customers, how many agents we needed staffed, and what specific phone Q's we needed to add. Those that helped in it's launch knew going in that it was going to be kind of crazy, but we knew that together we'd get through it. And we did. Today we have built out better processes surrounding what our Inbound team looks like and the service that we give to our customers. We have the highest QA scores amongst the rest of the organization, and that is something that I take great pride in. That I am able to give them the support that they need to be successful, and that I can coach to our quality standards. I liken customer retention to employee retention. Even your top performers need to have the same touch points as your low performers, because once you get comfortable and think they're solid with where there at, that's when the problems start. It's important to make sure that metrics are in place for each account, growth milestones, and to have proper communication cadence in place to stay ahead of the ball. I think it's important for a customer to feel like you are their go-to person, and that they can trust you. At the end of the day, we are all humans, and making that human connection with a client is going to do wonders for the overall health of the account. The most important thing is having tools in place to be able to do my job well. One of the most challenging things that I currently go through is not having those tools, and trying to make the best out of what I do. For example, there are a lot of inconsistencies with data which makes it difficult for us to be able to forecast accurately for business needs. Oftentimes when going through employee reviews, the tools we have to support their performance is lacking. Additionally, clear growth and variety in work is very important to me. I want to be with a company for a long time and be able to progress - not just into different roles, but have exposure to more challenging work.

All of my experiences have lended themselves to a robust understanding of what creates a client for life.  the endless possibilities.  With integrations and an inward flow of data, Salesforce can be used to monitor the health of a given client or segment at any given time.  The user friendliness of the reports and dashboards give internal users great insight to where the clientbase stands at any given moment i currently lead 2 cross-functional teams (5 client success managers, and 5 Field Service reps) that have worked together to hit our retention and sales metrics.  I'm proud of the fact that we've built this from the ground up.  This Client Success function didn't exist prior to my arrival and retention was low.  We've been able to come in and turn around the customer sentiment, keep people on the platform, and we grew the existing client base by over 10% last year. In order to retain clients, it's important to make sure that they are using and getting value out of the system.  I look at things like how many people are using the product at a given client, who sees the data, how often, how many different departments are seeing value - how deep are our roots.  It's important to track how they are using the system, are they using it at a very basic level, do they have all the bells and whistles, are they using the system in the way it was designed, are they engaging in feedback loops to constantly improve the product.  I also like to take into consideration things like contract growth, NPS, and satisfaction scores as well as client side parameters like POC turnover, executive turnover, and overall company health.  When any of these things change, there is a playbook for what happens to make sure that everything gets back in balance.

I started out as a sales associate, then was promoted to the position of floor supervisor. In 2000 I took a position with Wireless retail as an implementation manager, and in that role I worked with employees in five state region teaching best customer service practices and working to staff out locations with the best candidates available. In 2010 I embarked on a career path in higher education as an admissions advisor, the role of admissions advisor requires one to have excellent customer service and relationship building skills while being able to gain an understanding of client needs and being able to articulate a path to help them reach career and life goals. I followed that path to Career Education Corporation, and then on the Adler University where I has able to add to my skill set and learn how to best meet customer need. The career experience in addition to my educational background in business management have allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the customer success field, while learning how to be effective in leadership and helping to train and inspire others to work as a team to reach organizational goals. Yes  I like that Salesforce is a custom designed CRM that is implemented with the specific needs of the organization that is using it. Salesforce is easily navigable and helps to manage a large data base of leads. The last team I lead was with Career Education Corporation where I functioned as a department lead, my specific team consisted of eight advisors and I was tasked with developing best practices that lead to the better handling of leads, timely follow up, and superior customer service. We were able to routinely hit our monthly enrollment targets and stand out among other teams that we were compared to. I am most proud of the camaraderie that we developed as a team, and the way we were able to utilize the talents of each team member to meet our goals. My approach to managing customer health is the building of relationships with the customers we interact with, many times the area of opportunity that is missed is building the necessary rapport with the client base. It is imperative that the customer can feel that the person(s) that they are interacting with has a genuine care for them and the service that they are being provided. Metrics are key, measuring factors like customers contacted in a work day, timely follow up, and product knowledge all lead to good customer health. Ultimately thins factors can be positively effected by leaders paying attention to detail, and taking time to cultivate and develop their team.

For example I value strategizing with them on how to use the product more effectively and share what the trends are in the industry to keep them on top of their game and what are the other best practices are in the industry. I make room for important and urgent tasks first. Secondly, I devise a schedule. Remove myself social media and time suckers, learn how to say \"No\", allow others to help me and finally try not to multi-task if I\\'m going to waste time doing so. Yes As most customer leave because they feel you do not care about them, a great way to increase customer retention is to build the relationship. It\\'s not possible to make strategies to increase retention on paper, so having a wide range of data and information about your customers helps measure and analyze their behavior.  So, my company kept VIP customers, targeted customers with special offers, rewarded are most profitable customers, personalized follow ups and scheduled time with our customers.

It's great to see a project turn out to be a successful product for the client to understand and love. Depending on the project and tasks, I like to use collaborative tools such as Asana and Jira to balance work within the team. For myself, I keep a list of my tasks and must do responsibilities throughout the day. I've worked in software and as a project manager. While working at Buy Back Pros, I've been the lead project manager and work with  team of awesome developers, designers, and other project leads located all over the globe. Yes We implemented new features on our website which is where most of our clients process orders. We use heat maps to do analytics on where the clients are spending time and clicking. We also recently added a new support solution that allows us to instantly live chat with customers, have chat bots when staff are unavailable, and organize emails / tickets much more efficiently.  I tend do use more than just screenshots. Simple tools such as Screencastify allow a user to create video screencasts of their interface. It can record a tab, window, or the full screen. Audio can also be used as well. I've seen that this has made our communication much more clear. Yes  Yeah. I'd like to earn close to $65,000 living in Chicago.

I like to review all the things that need to be done in a given day and pick the things that I find to be most important or have the highest priority and attack those items first. Yes I think getting out to meet the customer face-to-face is very important. I spend 20-30% of every month in New York meeting with my clients. Also, I think building relationships with them outside of work is important as well. I have focused on taking my clients to lunch or dinner to get to know them on a personal level.  Of course. I do in-person demos with C-level clients and daily users. When not in New York (where most of my clients are based), I do a lot demos via WebEx. I try to ask a lot questions initially to try to get a better understanding of how the customer plans to use the product and then tailor the demo to those needs. Yes, I travel 20% of the time now.

I accomplish easier tasks as soon as possible, so I can focus on higher priority or larger projects more in depth. I also use my organization skills to prioritize. Yes I personally improved customer retention rates through constant communication with clients, offering discounts (with approval) or more focus if the client seemed to be unhappy. Through communication is also a key to success (monthly or weekly meetings with the client).  Budgeting, or the reliability of the software (example: how does the software work with scalability of users). Or does the software fully suit the customers needs. I have over three years of experience. In person at a company conference, at vendor booths, through training clients, or a weekly demos to either find new clients or introduce my current clients to more parts of the software.

Additionally, I enjoy cultivating relationships with my clients. I lean heavily on to-do lists broken down by client and prioritized. Then, I block time on my calendar each day to work on these projects amongst the other meetings that are going on. Yes By having a healthy paranoia with each account. If you assume each client is completely satisfied, you open the door to unpleasant surprises. Instead my teams have always managed our accounts trying to uncover anything that might be upsetting the client.  When I worked at HighGround, I was constantly tasked at presenting product demos that were tailored to the specific clients needs. Sometimes this would mean presenting a quick high level overview, and other times diving into the fine details.

I also utilize my outlook calendar, trello, jira, and other online project management tools to make sure that I'm organized and optimizing my time. Yes I spearheaded this project, we looked at the account analytics and figured out that account who purchased an annual subscription retained at a higher rate, so I reached out to monthly accounts that had a high enough engagement score and attempted to convert them to an annual subscription. I also provide very personal customer service that makes the accounts feel the love!  Customers leave because they don't feel they need the service. I feel like that falls under all of those categories. When it comes down to it, if you haven't built a relationship and onboard/trained the customer well enough to where the software isn't sticky, if they are not getting the results they want, they'll leave. I have presented product demos for Wonderlic's proprietary software, as well as presenting and training people to use our online marketing platform.
